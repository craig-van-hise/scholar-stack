### PRP: Domain-Weighted Semantic Expansion

**Role:** Senior AI/Search Architect

**Task:** Refactor the synonym generation to prioritize technical specificity over word count, ensuring the "Backdoor" finds specialized papers like Choueiri's.

#### 1. Title Pre-Filtering (The Junk Wall)

* **Action:** Locally filter the Expert Panel's 150+ titles.
* **Rule:** A title only goes to the LLM if it contains at least one domain word: `[audio, sound, acoustic, loudspeaker, binaural, signal, hrtf, ear, hear, microphone, loudspeaker]`.
* **Goal:** This prevents the "Seawater/Concrete" hallucination by making the non-audio work of the experts invisible to the LLM.

#### 2. Intelligence-Led Extraction (The LLM)

* **Instruction:** "Identify the 15 most specific technical synonyms, acronyms, or methods for '{keyword}'.
* **Rule:** Accept single-word terms if they are domain-specific (e.g., 'Transaural'). If a term is broad (e.g., 'Active Control'), expand it to be specific (e.g., 'Active Sound Control').
* **Constraint:** NO generic filler ('dataset', 'study', 'system'). NO full paper titles."

#### 3. The Dragnet & The Gate

* **Retrieval:** Search `(Original_Keyword OR Technical_Synonyms)`.
* **The Audit:** Use the **Robust PDF Front-Matter Auditor** to verify the presence of the original fuzzy regex (`cross[\s\-]*talk[\s\-]*cancellations?`) in the actual text of the first 2 pages.
