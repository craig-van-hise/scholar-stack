### PRP: The "Precision Dredge" Refactor

**Role:** Senior AI/Search Engineer

**Task:** Refactor the synonym generation and PDF auditing logic to eliminate semantic drift and PDF parsing errors.

#### 1. Context-Locked Vocabulary (Level 2 Fix)

* **Prompt Update:** "Extract 15 technical synonyms from these titles. RULE: Every synonym MUST be relevant to [Spatial Audio]. If a title is about 'Seawater' or 'Anodes', ignore it. PHRASES MUST BE 3-4 WORDS LONG (e.g., 'Multi-channel inverse filtering' instead of 'Inverse methods')."

#### 2. The "Dragnet" Constraint

* **Logic:** Re-introduce a "Soft Anchor." The final search should be: `(Original Keyword OR Technical Synonyms) AND (Topic OR Topic Synonyms)`.
* *Why:* Since our synonyms are currently too weak ("Active Control"), we need the topic anchor to stop the "Zinc Anode" papers from entering the pool in the first place.

#### 3. Robust PDF Text Extraction

* **Requirement:** Change the PyMuPDF extraction call to:
`page.get_text("text", flags=fitz.TEXT_PRESERVE_WHITESPACE | fitz.TEXT_DEHYPHENATE | fitz.TEXT_MEDIABOX_CLIP)`
* **Stability:** Wrap the extraction in a `try/except` that catches `RuntimeError` specifically for MuPDF syntax errors, allowing the script to skip the graphics and just read the text layer.
