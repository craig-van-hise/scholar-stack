    "Description": "A well-known issue in clinical audiology and hearing research is the level of abstraction of traditional experimental assessments and methods, which lack ecological validity and differ significantly from real-life experiences, often resulting in unreliable outcomes.Attempts to deal with this matter by, for example, performing experiments in real-life contexts, can be problematic due to the difficulty of accurately identifying control-specific parameters and events.Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) have the potential to provide dynamic and immersive audiovisual experiences that are at the same time realistic and highly controllable.Several successful attempts have been made to create and validate VR-based implementations of standard audiological and linguistic tests, as well as to design procedures and technologies to assess meaningful and ecologically-valid data.Similarly, new viewpoints on auditory perception have been provided by looking at hearing training and auditory sensory augmentation, aiming at improving perceptual skills in tasks such as speech understanding and sound-source localisation.",

    "Description": "The integration of virtual acoustic environments (VAEs) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers novel avenues to investigate behavioral and neural processes of speech-in-noise (SIN) comprehension in complex auditory scenes. Particularly in children with hearing aids (HAs), the combined application might offer new insights into the neural mechanism of SIN perception in simulated real-life acoustic scenarios. Here, we present first pilot data from six children with normal hearing (NH) and three children with bilateral HAs to explore the potential applicability of this novel approach. Children with NH received a speech recognition benefit from low room reverberation and target-distractors\u2019 spatial separation, particularly when the pitch of the target and the distractors was similar. On the neural level, the left inferior frontal gyrus appeared to support SIN comprehension during effortful listening. Children with HAs showed decreased SIN perception across conditions. The VAE-fNIRS approach is critically compared to traditional SIN assessments. Although the current study shows that feasibility still needs to be improved, the combined application potentially offers a promising tool to investigate novel research questions in simulated real-life listening. Future modified VAE-fNIRS applications are warranted to replicate the current findings and to validate its application in research and clinical settings.",

    "Title": "A study on the auralization system using flexible rendering for virtual reality-based acoustic simulation",
    "Authors": "Yeongchan Lee, Jaeho Ryu",
    "Filename": "A_study_on_the_auralization_system_using_flexible_.pdf",
    "Description": "It is not easy for architects to consider the effect of the acoustic environment of a plan in the early design phase because it requires great expertise to properly use acoustic simulation software. The importance of a room\u2019s acoustics has increased, so a solution that makes the accessibility of acoustic design work for architects is demanded. We developed a kind of acoustic simulation system that can provide a service for architects using virtual reality technology. In this paper, we described how to implement real-time sound representation with the system, which is connected to the visual data of a virtual reality headset and the acoustic simulation. Although there have been many studies using virtual reality technologies in acoustic simulation that have been conducted for a long time, some limitations have been unresolved, such as cost and portability problems. This study tried to realize flexible rendering using vector base amplitude panning (VBAP) and multi-channel speakers with an auralization method. In this paper, we propose a system that implements spatial sound around one person by using 11 speakers and VBAP, and we made a prototype to verify system function. We applied an acoustic ray tracing algorithm by using the Unity game engine and MAX digital signal processing software to control multiple speakers at the same time for VBAP. The hardware part of this system consists of an audio interface, two digital to analog converters (DAC), 11 mono amplifiers, and 11 full-range loudspeakers. The three-dimensional layout of the loudspeakers was based on an icosahedron to maximize the performance of VBAP. We tested the prototype of the system to verify its effectiveness and confirmed the change of sound pressure level according to the distance from the sound source and the sound absorption coefficient of the wall. In a reliability test of the performance of sound image localization by human cognitive ability, the result was a match rate of 89.4%, which proved the usefulness of this system for sound simulation for architects with low cost and easy portability.",

    "Title": "Auralization of Environmental Acoustical Sceneries",
    "Authors": "Reto Pieren",
    "Filename": "Auralization_of_Environmental_Acoustical_Sceneries.pdf",
    "Description": "Environmental noise caused by traffic and industrial facilities is a relevant health factor in urban areas, along major traffic routes and in the vicinity of airports. The technique of auralization helps exploring the relationships between sound and its impact on people under fully controlled conditions. Further, by directly addressing the hearing sensation, it is an intuitive tool for the assessment and communication of environmental noise scenarios. Analogous to visualization, auralization enables us to listen to situations that do not exist in reality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this thesis research, methods for the auralization of environmental acoustical sceneries are established. The sceneries are represented by a virtual environment containing virtual sound sources that are arranged in space and time, and within which sound waves propagate to a virtual observer. To that aim, sophisticated calculation models for the synthesis and reproduction of road traffic, railway and wind turbine noise are developed. This requires investigating the relevance of the involved acoustical phenomena for perceived realism. On that basis, calculation models (i.e. synthesizer structures) are proposed that adequately reproduce source characteristics, sound propagation effects, and spatial impression. The models are accompanied by methods to derive the necessary input parameters from own measurements and data analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The presented calculation models are parametric and thus allow for a large versatility with respect to scenarios and sound reproduction. Because the three considered environmental noise sources feature their specific acoustical peculiarities, source-specific models are proposed. These source-specific models have in common that the sound radiated by a source is artificially generated using digital sound synthesis. For wind turbine and road traffic noise, a combination of additive and subtractive synthesis, denoted as spectral modeling synthesis, is applied. A uniqueness of the wind turbine synthesizer is the ability to reproduce and control different types of characteristic amplitude modulation. The synthesizer for road vehicles separately produces tire noise and propulsion noise. The generated propulsion sounds depend on the engine type, the instantaneous engine condition (engine speed and load), and the emission angle. An additional special feature of the propulsion sound synthesis is the fact that, besides amplitude and frequency, the phase of the engine harmonics has to and is considered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For railway rolling and impact noise, in contrast, a physically-based synthesis approach has been developed that describes the mechanical excitation and the vibration of the dynamic wheel/rail system. The corresponding model considers the microstructure of the wheels and rails, as well as structural resonances of the wheel/rail system to elicit the typical metallic sound character of railway noise. In all models, sound pro...",

    "Description": "The role of acoustics in architectural planning processes is often neglected if the designer lacks necessary experience in acoustics. Even if an acoustic consultant is involved he might be presentedwith limited options after the initial planning process. Some disadvantageous decisions might be hard to reverse then. To improve and facilitate the construction process permanent immediate feedback should be given to the designer. Planning cannot be imaged today without live 3D visual rendering. But also acoustics should be rendered in real-time to provide the same type of intuitive feedback. Therefore a real-time room acoustics auralization was implemented into a popular CAD-Modeling tool. Binaural room impulse responses are continuously updated using image sources and ray tracing algorithms and convolved in real-time with audio feed from recorded sounds or the user\u2019s microphone. The CAD model can be freely modified during the simulations including geometry, surface materials and source and receiver positions. Using streaming low-latency convolution, an immediate feedback is provided to the user.",

    "Filename": "Virtual_Reality_System_with_Integrated_Sound_Field.pdf",
    "Description": "A real-time audio rendering system is introduced which combines a full room-specific simulation, dynamic crosstalk cancellation, and multitrack binaural synthesis for virtual acoustical imaging. The system is applicable for any room shape (normal, long, flat, coupled), independent of the a priori assumption of a diffuse sound field. This provides the possibility of simulating indoor or outdoor spatially distributed, freely movable sources and a moving listener in virtual environments. In addition to that, near-to-head sources can be simulated by using measured near-field HRTFs. The reproduction component consists of a headphone-free reproduction by dynamic crosstalk cancellation. The focus of the project is mainly on the integration and interaction of all involved subsystems. It is demonstrated that the system is capable of real-time room simulation and reproduction and, thus, can be used as a reliable platform for further research on VR applications.",
