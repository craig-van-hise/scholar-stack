    "Description": "Para simular computacionalmente fuentes sonoras distribuidas espacialmente y lograr sonido tridimensional, se utilizan las funciones de transferencia de cabeza (HRTFs) como filtros. Para completar una esfera densa de puntos con estas funciones alrededor de un sujeto, es necesario posicionar una fuente sonora en diferentes \u00e1ngulos y capturar las respuestas impulsivas mediante micr\u00f3fonos ubicados en las orejas. Actualmente, estamos desarrollando un sistema de medici\u00f3n de HRTFs que cuenta con un arco soporte semicircular vertical para altavoces y una plataforma rotativa horizontal controlable donde se ubica el sujeto. Contamos con una plataforma dise\u00f1ada originalmente para otro prop\u00f3sito y que soporta hasta 400 N de peso. En este trabajo se propone redise\u00f1arla y optimizarla para permitir el movimiento de una persona sentada, tolerando hasta ~2200 N. En base a ensayos realizados sobre la plataforma actual, se detectaron situaciones f\u00edsicas no deseadas y se propusieron soluciones validadas mediante modelos te\u00f3ricos y simulaciones num\u00e9ricas del comportamiento est\u00e1tico.",

    "Description": "We present a real-time bidirectional communication system that lets two people, separated by distance, experience a face-to-face conversation as if they were copresent. It is the first telepresence system that is demonstrably better than 2D videoconferencing, as measured using participant ratings (e.g., presence, attentiveness, reaction-gauging, engagement), meeting recall, and observed nonverbal behaviors (e.g., head nods, eyebrow movements). This milestone is reached by maximizing audiovisual fidelity and the sense of copresence in all design elements, including physical layout, lighting, face tracking, multi-view capture, microphone array, multi-stream compression, loudspeaker output, and lenticular display. Our system achieves key 3D audiovisual cues (stereopsis, motion parallax, and spatialized audio) and enables the full range of communication cues (eye contact, hand gestures, and body language), yet does not require special glasses or body-worn microphones/headphones. The system consists of a head-tracked autostereoscopic display, high-resolution 3D capture and rendering subsystems, and network transmission using compressed color and depth video streams. Other contributions include a novel image-based geometry fusion algorithm, free-space dereverberation, and talker localization.",

    "Title": "The Availability of a Hidden Real Reference Affects the Plausibility of Position-Dynamic Auditory AR",
    "Authors": "Annika Neidhardt, Anna Maria Zerlik",
    "Filename": "The_Availability_of_a_Hidden_Real_Reference_Affect.pdf",
    "Description": "This study examines the plausibility of Auditory Augmented Reality (AAR) realized with position-dynamic binaural synthesis over headphones. An established method to evaluate the plausibility of AAR asks participants to decide whether they are listening to the virtual or real version of the sound object. To date, this method has only been used to evaluate AAR systems for seated listeners. The AAR realization examined in this study instead allows listeners to turn to arbitrary directions and walk towards, past, and away from a real loudspeaker that reproduced sound only virtually. The experiment was conducted in two parts. In the first part, the subjects were asked whether they are listening to the real or the virtual version, not knowing that it was always the virtual version. In the second part, the real versions of the scenes where the loudspeaker actually reproduced sound were added. Two different source positions, three different test stimuli, and two different sound levels were considered. Seventeen volunteers, including five experts, participated. In the first part, none of the participants noticed that the virtual reproduction was active throughout the different test scenes. The inexperienced listeners tended to accept the virtual reproduction as real, while experts distributed their answers approximately equally. In the second part, experts could identify the virtual version quite reliably. For inexperienced listeners, the individual results varied enormously. Since the presence of the headphones influences the perception of the real sound field, this shadowing effect had to be considered in the creation of the virtual sound source as well. This requirement still limits test methods considering the real version in its ecological validity. Although the results indicate that the availability of a hidden real reference leads to a more critical evaluation, it is crucial to be aware that the presence of the headphones slightly distorts the reference. This issue seems more vital to the plausibility estimates achieved with this evaluation method than the increased freedom in motion.",

    "Title": "Performance Enhancement of Cross-Talk Canceller for Four-Speaker System by Selective Speaker Operation",
    "Authors": "Sujin Choi, Jeong-Yong BOO, Ki Jun Kim, Hochong Park",
    "Filename": "Performance_Enhancement_of_Cross-Talk_Canceller_fo.pdf",
    "Description": "We propose a method of enhancing the performance of a cross-talk canceller for a four-speaker system with respect to sweet spot size and ringing effect. For the large sweet spot of a cross-talk canceller, the speaker layout needs to be symmetrical to the listener's position. In addition, a ringing effect of the cross-talk canceller is reduced when many speakers are located close to each other. Based on these properties, the proposed method first selects the two speakers in a four-speaker system that are most symmetrical to the target listener's position and then adds the remaining speakers between these two to the final selection. By operating only these selected speakers, the proposed method enlarges the sweet spot size and reduces the ringing effect. We conducted objective and subjective evaluations and verified that the proposed method improves the performance of the cross-talk canceller compared to the conventional method.",

    "Authors": "Claus Lynge Christensen, Jens Holger Rindel",
    "Filename": "A_transparency_model_and_its_applications_for_simu.pdf",
    "Description": "The paper describes a new method for simulating the frequency-dependent reflection and transmission of reflector arrays, and the frequency-dependent airborne sound insulation between rooms by means of a room acoustic computer model. The method makes use of a transparency method in the ray-tracing process. In the first step of the calculation the rays hitting the relevant surfaces may either be reflected or transmitted, using a probability of 50%. In the next step the impulse responses in the receiver positions are calculated using a frequency-dependent correction to account for the reflected or transmitted energy. The method applied for the reflector array is based on a theoretical model that takes into account the dimensions of the reflecting surface, path lengths, and angle of incidence. The transmission calculation is based on the users\u2019 data for the frequency-dependent transmission loss of the partition, and this is useful for the auralization of sound transmission through different building constructions. The acoustic properties like volume, reverberation time, and the area of the transmitting surfaces are included in the simulation.",

    "Filename": "A_Spatial_Audio_System_Using_Multiple_Microphones_.pdf",
    "Description": "The main purpose of a spatial audio system is to give a listener the same impression as if he/she were present in a recorded environment. A dummy head microphone is generally used for such purposes. Because of its human-like shape, we can obtain good spatial sound images. However, its shape is a restriction on its public use and it is difficult to convert a 2-channel recording into multi-channel signals for an efficient rendering over a multi-speaker arrangement. In order to solve the problems mentioned above, a spatial audio system is proposed that uses multiple microphones on a rigid sphere. The system has five microphones placed on special points of the rigid sphere, and it generates audio signals for headphone, stereo, stereo dipole, 4-channel, and 5-channel reproduction environments. Subjective localization experiments show that front/back confusion, which is a common limitation of spatial audio systems using the dummy head microphone, can be reduced dramatically in 4-channel and 5-channel reproduction environments and can be reduced slightly in a headphone reproduction",
