    "Description": "Immersive audio technologies, ranging from rendering spatialized sounds accurately to efficient room simulations, are vital to the success of augmented and virtual realities. To produce realistic sounds through headphones, the human body and head must both be taken into account. However, the measurement of the influence of the external human morphology on the sounds incoming to the ears, which is often referred to as head-related transfer function (HRTF), is expensive and time-consuming. Several datasets have been created over the years to help researcherswork on immersive audio; nevertheless, the number of individuals involved and amount of data collected is often insufficient for modern machine-learning approaches. Here, the SONICOM HRTF dataset is introduced to facilitate reproducible research in immersive audio. This dataset contains the HRTF of 120 subjects, as well as headphone transfer functions; 3D scans of ears, heads, and torsos; and depth pictures at different angles around subjects' heads.",

    "Description": "Mesh2HRTF 1.x is an open-source and fully scriptable end-to-end pipeline for the numerical calculation of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). The calculations are based on 3D meshes of listener\u2019s body parts such as the head, pinna, and torso. The numerical core of Mesh2HRTF is written in C++ and employs the boundary-element method for solving the Helmholtz equation. It is accelerated by a multilevel fast multipole method and can easily be parallelized to further speed up the computations. The recently refactored framework of Mesh2HRTF 1.x contains tools for preparing the meshes as well as specific post-processing and inspection of the calculatedHRTFs. The resultingHRTFs are saved in the spatially oriented format for acoustics being directly applicable in virtual and augmented reality applications and psychoacoustic research. The Mesh2HRTF 1.x code is automatically tested to assure high quality and reliability. A comprehensive online documentation enables easy access for users without in-depth knowledge of acoustic simulations.",

    "Filename": "Spatially_Oriented_Format_for_Acoustics_2.1_Introd.pdf",
    "Description": "Spatially oriented acoustic data can range from a simple set of impulse responses, such as head-related transfer functions, to a large set of multiple-input multiple-output spatial room impulse responses obtained in complex measurements with a microphone array excited by a loudspeaker array at various conditions. The spatially oriented format for acoustics (SOFA), which was standardized by AES Standard 69, provides a format to store and share such data. SOFA takes into account geometric representations of many acoustic scenarios, data compression, network transfer, and a link to complex room geometries and aims at simplifying the development of interfaces for many programming languages. With the recent advancement of SOFA, the format offers new continuous-direction representation of data by means of spherical harmonics and novel conventions representing many measurement scenarios, such as source directivity and multiple-input multiple-output spatial room impulse responses. This article reviews SOFA by first providing an introduction to SOFA and then describing examples that demonstrate the most recent features of the SOFA 2.1 (AES Standard 69-2022).",

    "Title": "Towards Faster Continuous Multi-Channel HRTF Measurements Based On Learning System Models",
    "Authors": "Tobias Kabzinski, Peter Jax",
    "Filename": "Towards_Faster_Continuous_Multi-Channel_HRTF_Measu.pdf",
    "Description": "Measuring personal head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) is essential in binaural audio. Personal HRTFs are not only required for binaural rendering and for loudspeaker-based binaural reproduction using crosstalk cancellation, but they also serve as a basis for data-driven HRTF individualization techniques and psychoacoustic experiments. Although many attempts have been made to expedite HRTF measurements, the rotational velocities in today's measurement systems remain lower than those in natural head movements. To cope with faster rotations, we present a novel continuous HRTF measurement method. This method estimates the HRTFs offline using a Kalman smoother and learns state-space parameters, including the system model, on short signal segments, utilizing the expectation maximization algorithm. We evaluated our method in simulated single-channel and multi-channel measurements using a rigid sphere HRTF model. Comparing with conventional methods, we found that the system distances are improved by up to 30 dB.",

    "Authors": "Peter John Cusack Coleman, Philip J. B. Jackson, Marek Olik, Martin Bo M\u00f8ller, Martin Olsen, Jan Abildgaard Pedersen",
    "Filename": "Acoustic_contrast,_planarity_and_robustness_of_sou.pdf",
    "Description": "Since the mid 1990s, acoustics research has been undertaken relating to the sound zone problem\u2014using loudspeakers to deliver a region of high sound pressure while simultaneously creating an area where the sound is suppressed\u2014in order to facilitate independent listening within the same acoustic enclosure. The published solutions to the sound zone problem are derived from areas such as wave field synthesis and beamforming. However, the properties of such methods differ and performance tends to be compared against similar approaches. In this study, the suitability of energy focusing, energy cancelation, and synthesis approaches for sound zone reproduction is investigated. Anechoic simulations based on two zones surrounded by a circular array show each of the methods to have a characteristic performance, quantified in terms of acoustic contrast, array control effort and target sound field planarity. Regularization is shown to have a significant effect on the array effort and achieved acoustic contrast, particularly when mismatched conditions are considered between calculation of the source weights and their application to the system.",

    "Description": "The well-established static head-related transfer function (HRTF) measurement approaches using maximum length sequences and sine sweeps are compared with a recent HRTF estimation approach using normalized least mean square adaptive filters, which enables a continuous movement of the person to be measured during the recording of the excitation signal. By using continuous movement HRTF measurement, a huge amount of time for the individual HRTF estimation can be saved to create a dense HRTF database for headphone-based sound synthesis or applications such as crosstalk cancellation for loudspeaker-based sound synthesis. The different approaches are implemented and experimentally compared by objective and subjective evaluation.",

    "Authors": "Shouichi Takane, Y\u00f4iti Suzuki, Tohru Miyajima, Toshio Sone",
    "Filename": "A_new_theory_for_high_definition_virtual_acoustic_.pdf",
    "Description": "A new theory for high definition Virtual Acoustic Display (VAD) based on a model called the \u201cVirtual Sphere (VS) model\u201d is introduced in this paper. This method is named ADVISE (Acoustic Display based on the VIrtual SpherE model). In ADVISE, a sphere-shaped boundary is defined around a listener, and the sound transmission from the sound source in the original field to the entrances of the listener\u2019s ears is divided into two parts. One consists of Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) corresponding to the points on the boundary of the virtual sphere, and the other consists of Room Transfer Functions (RTFs) from the sound source to the points on the boundary. Then, these two kinds of transfer functions are convolved in real-time, taking into account the dynamic changes in these functions due to the listener\u2019s head movement. The Kirchhoff-Helmholtz boundary integral equation is the theoretical basis of this idea. This equation represents that a sound field generated by sound sources outside a certain closed boundary can be synthesized by phantom monopole and dipole sources distributed on the boundary. In this paper, the theory of ADVISE is stated, then the features of ADVISE are described.",
