    "Description": "Spatial decomposition techniques can help to compensate for some of the limitations of higher order Ambisonics (HOA).Compared to HOA, higher order spatial impulse response rendering (HO-SIRR) has proven to substantially increase the sweet spot of a simulated space.For HO-SIRR-simulated scenes, it has also been shown that the performance of hearing aid beamformers is closer to the performance in real acoustic environments, and that interaural time and level differences are more similar to those recorded with an artificial head (KEMAR) in the original space than with a simulation based on simple HOA.However, with spatial decomposition techniques, it is more difficult to simulate sources at various distances, especially when trying to simulate focused sources within a loudspeaker array.In this presentation, we describe a near-field source rendering technique.HOA and hearing aid recordings were made in a reference room.The method presented in this paper was compared to HOA and HO-SIRR methods in a sound reproduction room, with regard to direct-toreverberant ratio (DRR), coherence, and performance of the hearing aid beamformer.",

    "Description": "To better understand acoustic environment and the resulting auditory perception, it is essential to capture, analyze, and reproduce a sound field as a three-dimensional physical phenomenon because spatial aspects of auditory perception play important roles in various situations in our lives. Some approaches have been proposed to achieve the three-dimensional capture and reproduction of acoustic fields. Among them, Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA) based on spherical harmonics expansion enables the capture and reproduction of a directivity pattern of incoming sound waves. On the basis of HOA, three-dimensional auditory space can be presented to a listener typically via a spherical loudspeaker array. In addition, binaural synthesis emulating the loudspeaker presentation enables HOA reproduction with a set of headphones or several loudspeakers by employing crosstalk cancellation. Thus, we are developing an HOA-based binaural reproduction/auralization system with head tracking. This system is aimed at realizing the reproduction and auralization of a sound field, including one excited by the listener's own voice. In this paper, we review the topics related to the reproduction and auralization of the sound field and introduce the HOA-based binaural synthesis system we have developed, as well as our works on sweet-spot expansion in HOA decoding and self-voice reproduction/auralization.",

    "Description": "Popular room acoustic simulations use hybrid models for precise calculation of the early specular reflections and stochastic algorithms for the late diffuse decay. Splitting the impulse response into early and late parts is also psychoacoustically reasonable. The early part is responsible for the localization and the spatial and spectral perception of sources, which makes the correct reproduction of its time-frequency structure important. In contrast the later part is responsible for the sense of spaciousness and envelopment, properties related to the room and its diffuse decay. Nevertheless, in auralization systems the reproduction of the whole impulse response is done through the same reproduction system and method, even though there are systems better suited to coherent reproduction (important for the early arrivals of an impulse response) and others better suited for the reproduction of incoherent fields (the reverberant tail of an impulse response). A hybrid approach is presented which uses one common loudspeaker system for the simultaneous rendering of different reproduction methods. A method with strong localization cues such as binaural via crosstalk cancellation or VBAP is used for the direct sound and early reflections, while a method with higher immersion and envelopment such as Ambisonics is used for the diffuse decay.",
