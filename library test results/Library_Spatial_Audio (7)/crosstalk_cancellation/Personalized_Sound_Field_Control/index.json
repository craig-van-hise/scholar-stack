    "Description": "The extent to which the performance of personal sound zone (PSZ) reproduction systems is impacted by the individualization of Binaural Room Transfer Functions (BRTFs) and the coupling between the listeners' BRTFs was investigated experimentally.Such knowledge can be valuable for deriving rules for the design of high-performance, robust PSZ systems.The performance of a PSZ system consisting of eight frontal mid-range loudspeakers was objectively evaluated with PSZ filters designed using individualized BRTFs of a human listener and generic ones measured from a mannequin head, in terms of Inter-Zone Isolation, Inter-Program Isolation, and robustness against slight head misalignments.It was found that when no misalignments were introduced, Inter-Zone Isolation and Inter-Program Isolation are improved by an average of around 4 dB at all frequencies between 200 and 7,000 Hz by the individualized filters, compared to the generic ones.With constrained head misalignments, the robustness of both filters decreases as the frequency increases, and although the individualized filters maintain higher performance, their robustness above 2 kHz is lower than that of the generic ones.The evaluation also reveals an inter-listener BRTF coupling effect and a detrimental impact on the performance for both listeners when a single listener's BRTF is mismatched.",

    "Description": "Sound rendering is increasingly being required to extend over certain regions of space for multiple listeners, known as personal sound zones, with minimum interference to listeners in other regions. In this article, we present a systematic overview of the major challenges that have to be dealt with for multizone sound control in a room. Sound control over multiple zones is formulated as an optimization problem, and a unified framework is presented to compare two state-of-the-art sound control techniques. While conventional techniques have been focusing on point-to-point audio processing, we introduce a wave-domain sound field representation and active room compensation for sound pressure control over a region of space. The design of directional loudspeakers is presented and the advantages of using arrays of directional sources are illustrated for sound reproduction, such as better control of sound fields over wide areas and reduced total number of loudspeaker units, thus making it particularly suitable for establishing personal sound zones.",
