    "Description": "Quasi-continuous system identification of time-variant linear acoustic systems can be applied in various audio signal processing applications when numerous acoustic transfer functions must be measured. A prominent application is measuring head-related transfer functions. We treat the underlying multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system identification problem in a state-space model as a joint estimation problem for states, representing impulse responses, and state-space model parameters using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We address limitations of prior work by imposing different model structures, especially for dependencies within a (transformed) state vector. This results in block diagonal matrix structures, for which we derive M-step update rules. Making assumptions about this model structure and choosing a block size for a given application define the computational complexity. In examples, we found that applying this framework yields improvements of up to 10&#x2009;dB in relative system distance in comparison to a conventional method.",

    "Description": "Cross-head transmission inherent in bone conduction (BC) hearing is one of the most important factors that limit the performance of BC binaural hearing compared to air conduction (AC) binaural hearing. In AC, cross-head transmission is imperceptible leading to a clear understanding of the nature and position of the sound source(s). In this study, the prominence of cross-head transmission in BC hearing is addressed using the fact that ipsilateral cochlear excitation can be canceled by controlled bilateral BC stimulation. A cancellation experiment was conducted on twenty participants with normal hearing at thirteen third-octave frequencies between 250 and 4000 Hz. Both stationary and transient BC stimulation at the mastoid was used. The technique employed multiple stages of masking enabling adjustments of the stimulation level and phase until the tones got canceled in the ipsilateral ear. In addition, the ear canal sound pressure was obtained for ipsilateral and contralateral BC stimulation in isolation, and with bilateral BC stimulation at perceptual cancellation. The inter-aural level differences of both the types of stimulations were found to be the same. Crosstalk was found to be the lowest around 2 kHz and the highest around 1 kHz. The unwrapped inter-aural phase difference from stationary signal cancellation showed an overall increase with frequency starting at around no difference (35\u00b0) at 250 Hz to reach 607\u00b0 at 4 kHz. Cycle-adjusted inter-aural time difference was very low (61 \u00b5s) at 250 Hz and increased to 1.1 ms at 800 Hz before falling to 0.6 ms at 4 kHz. It was also found that the ear canal sound pressure was not cancelled at the same phase as the sound in the cochlea.",
