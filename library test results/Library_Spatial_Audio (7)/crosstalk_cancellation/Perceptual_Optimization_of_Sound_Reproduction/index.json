    "Description": "Binaural technology allows to capture sound fields by recording the sound pressure arriving at the listener\u2019s ear canal entrances. If these signals are reconstructed for the same listener the simulation should be indistinguishable from the corresponding real sound field. A simulation fulfilling this premise could be termed as perceptually authentic. Authenticity has been assessed previously for static binaural resynthesis of sound sources in anechoic environments, i.e. for HRTF-based simulations not accounting for head movements of the listeners. Results indicated that simulations were still discernable from real sound fields, at least, if critical audio material was used. However, for dynamic binaural synthesis to our knowledge \u2013 and probably because this technology is even more demanding \u2013 no such study has been conducted so far. Thus, having developed a state-of-the-art system for individual dynamic auralization of anechoic and reverberant acoustical environments, we assessed its perceptual authenticity by letting subjects directly compare binaural simulations and real sound fields. To this end, individual binaural room impulses were acquired for two different source positions in a medium-sized recording studio, as well as individual headphone transfer functions. Listening tests were conducted for two different audio contents applying a most sensitive ABX test paradigm. Results showed that for speech signals many of the subjects failed to reliably detect the simulation. For pink noise pulses, however, all subjects could distinguish the simulation from reality. Results further provided evidence for future improvements.",

    "Title": "Perceptual Optimization of Room-In-Room Reproduction with Spatially Distributed Loudspeakers",
    "Authors": "Julian Grosse, Steven van de Par",
    "Filename": "Perceptual_Optimization_of_Room-In-Room_Reproducti.pdf",
    "Description": "It is often desirable to reproduce a specific room-acoustic scene, e.g. a concert hall in a playback room, in such a way that the listener has a plausible and authentic spatial impression of the original sound source including the room acoustical properties. In this study a perceptually motivated approach for spatial audio reproduction is developed. This approach optimizes the spatial and monaural cues of the direct and reverberant sound separately. More specifically, the (monaural) spectral cues responsible for the timbre and the (binaural) interaural cross correlation (IACC) cues, responsible for the listener envelopment, were optimized in the playback room to restore the auditory impression of the recording room. The direct sound recorded close to the source is processed with an auditory motivated gammatone filterbank such that the spectral cues, ITD\u2019s and ILD\u2019s are comparable to the direct sound in the recording room. Additionally, the reverberant sound, which was recorded at two distant locations from the source, is played back via dipole loudspeakers. Due to the arrangement of the two dipole loudspeakers, only the diffuse sound field in the playback room is excited, therefore the spectral cues and the IACC of the reverberant sound field can be controlled independently to match the cues that were present in the recording room. As indicated by a preliminary listening test the applied optimization is perceptually similar to the reference signal and is generally preferred when compared to a conventional room-in-room reproduction.",
