    "Description": "Quasi-continuous system identification of time-variant linear acoustic systems can be applied in various audio signal processing applications when numerous acoustic transfer functions must be measured. A prominent application is measuring head-related transfer functions. We treat the underlying multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system identification problem in a state-space model as a joint estimation problem for states, representing impulse responses, and state-space model parameters using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We address limitations of prior work by imposing different model structures, especially for dependencies within a (transformed) state vector. This results in block diagonal matrix structures, for which we derive M-step update rules. Making assumptions about this model structure and choosing a block size for a given application define the computational complexity. In examples, we found that applying this framework yields improvements of up to 10&#x2009;dB in relative system distance in comparison to a conventional method.",

    "Description": "Mesh2HRTF 1.x is an open-source and fully scriptable end-to-end pipeline for the numerical calculation of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). The calculations are based on 3D meshes of listener\u2019s body parts such as the head, pinna, and torso. The numerical core of Mesh2HRTF is written in C++ and employs the boundary-element method for solving the Helmholtz equation. It is accelerated by a multilevel fast multipole method and can easily be parallelized to further speed up the computations. The recently refactored framework of Mesh2HRTF 1.x contains tools for preparing the meshes as well as specific post-processing and inspection of the calculatedHRTFs. The resultingHRTFs are saved in the spatially oriented format for acoustics being directly applicable in virtual and augmented reality applications and psychoacoustic research. The Mesh2HRTF 1.x code is automatically tested to assure high quality and reliability. A comprehensive online documentation enables easy access for users without in-depth knowledge of acoustic simulations.",

    "Description": "Immersive audio technologies, ranging from rendering spatialized sounds accurately to efficient room simulations, are vital to the success of augmented and virtual realities. To produce realistic sounds through headphones, the human body and head must both be taken into account. However, the measurement of the influence of the external human morphology on the sounds incoming to the ears, which is often referred to as head-related transfer function (HRTF), is expensive and time-consuming. Several datasets have been created over the years to help researcherswork on immersive audio; nevertheless, the number of individuals involved and amount of data collected is often insufficient for modern machine-learning approaches. Here, the SONICOM HRTF dataset is introduced to facilitate reproducible research in immersive audio. This dataset contains the HRTF of 120 subjects, as well as headphone transfer functions; 3D scans of ears, heads, and torsos; and depth pictures at different angles around subjects' heads.",

    "Title": "Towards Faster Continuous Multi-Channel HRTF Measurements Based On Learning System Models",
    "Authors": "Tobias Kabzinski, Peter Jax",
    "Filename": "Towards_Faster_Continuous_Multi-Channel_HRTF_Measu.pdf",
    "Description": "Measuring personal head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) is essential in binaural audio. Personal HRTFs are not only required for binaural rendering and for loudspeaker-based binaural reproduction using crosstalk cancellation, but they also serve as a basis for data-driven HRTF individualization techniques and psychoacoustic experiments. Although many attempts have been made to expedite HRTF measurements, the rotational velocities in today's measurement systems remain lower than those in natural head movements. To cope with faster rotations, we present a novel continuous HRTF measurement method. This method estimates the HRTFs offline using a Kalman smoother and learns state-space parameters, including the system model, on short signal segments, utilizing the expectation maximization algorithm. We evaluated our method in simulated single-channel and multi-channel measurements using a rigid sphere HRTF model. Comparing with conventional methods, we found that the system distances are improved by up to 30 dB.",

    "Title": "Four-Directional Ambisonic Spatial Decomposition Method With Reduced Temporal Artifacts",
    "Authors": "Elias Hoffbauer, Matthias Frank",
    "Filename": "Four-Directional_Ambisonic_Spatial_Decomposition_M.pdf",
    "Description": "For the creation of convincing virtual acoustics of existing rooms and spaces, it is useful to apply measured Ambisonic room impulse responses (ARIRs) as a convolution reverb.Typically, tetrahedral arrays offering only first-order resolution are the preferred practical choice for measurements, because they are easily available and processed.In contrast, higher order is preferred in playback because it is superior in terms of localization accuracy and spatial clarity.There are a number of algorithms that enhance the spatial resolution of firstorder ARIRs.However, these algorithms may introduce coloration and artifacts.This paper presents an improvement of the Ambisonic Spatial Decomposition Method by using four directions simultaneously.The additional signals increase the echo density and thereby better preserve the diffuse sound field components during the process of enhancing measured firstorder ARIRs to higher orders.An instrumental validation and a series of listening experiments compare the proposed Four-Directional Ambisonic Spatial Decomposition Method to other existing algorithms and prove its similarity to the best algorithm in terms of enhanced spatial clarity and coloration while producing the least artifacts.",

    "Filename": "Spatially_Oriented_Format_for_Acoustics_2.1_Introd.pdf",
    "Description": "Spatially oriented acoustic data can range from a simple set of impulse responses, such as head-related transfer functions, to a large set of multiple-input multiple-output spatial room impulse responses obtained in complex measurements with a microphone array excited by a loudspeaker array at various conditions. The spatially oriented format for acoustics (SOFA), which was standardized by AES Standard 69, provides a format to store and share such data. SOFA takes into account geometric representations of many acoustic scenarios, data compression, network transfer, and a link to complex room geometries and aims at simplifying the development of interfaces for many programming languages. With the recent advancement of SOFA, the format offers new continuous-direction representation of data by means of spherical harmonics and novel conventions representing many measurement scenarios, such as source directivity and multiple-input multiple-output spatial room impulse responses. This article reviews SOFA by first providing an introduction to SOFA and then describing examples that demonstrate the most recent features of the SOFA 2.1 (AES Standard 69-2022).",

    "Description": "Para simular computacionalmente fuentes sonoras distribuidas espacialmente y lograr sonido tridimensional, se utilizan las funciones de transferencia de cabeza (HRTFs) como filtros. Para completar una esfera densa de puntos con estas funciones alrededor de un sujeto, es necesario posicionar una fuente sonora en diferentes \u00e1ngulos y capturar las respuestas impulsivas mediante micr\u00f3fonos ubicados en las orejas. Actualmente, estamos desarrollando un sistema de medici\u00f3n de HRTFs que cuenta con un arco soporte semicircular vertical para altavoces y una plataforma rotativa horizontal controlable donde se ubica el sujeto. Contamos con una plataforma dise\u00f1ada originalmente para otro prop\u00f3sito y que soporta hasta 400 N de peso. En este trabajo se propone redise\u00f1arla y optimizarla para permitir el movimiento de una persona sentada, tolerando hasta ~2200 N. En base a ensayos realizados sobre la plataforma actual, se detectaron situaciones f\u00edsicas no deseadas y se propusieron soluciones validadas mediante modelos te\u00f3ricos y simulaciones num\u00e9ricas del comportamiento est\u00e1tico.",
