    "Description": "This study explores the localization of virtual sound sources reproduced by a crosstalk cancellation system under different reflective conditions in virtual rooms, analyzing the results with binaural cues. Binaural room impulse responses were generated using the high-order image source method. By modifying the acoustic parameters of the virtual room to manipulate reflection intensity and temporal structure, psychoacoustic experiments were conducted using headphone reproduction. Results show that variations in reflection intensity within a certain range, achieved by altering the room reverberation time (RT), do not significantly affect virtual source localization. However, increasing the loudspeaker\u2013listener distance (altering the temporal structure of reflections) deteriorates localization performance. The main difference between changes in loudspeaker\u2013listener distance and RT lies in whether the reflection\u2019s temporal structure changes. The study highlights the critical role of reflection temporal structure in virtual source localization. Binaural cue analysis shows that even in reverberant environments, interaural time difference (ITD) remains more consistent with localization accuracy than interaural level difference (ILD).",

    "Title": "Inter-aural separation during hearing by bilateral bone conduction stimulation",
    "Authors": "Sudeep Surendran, Stefan Stenfelt",
    "Filename": "Inter-aural_separation_during_hearing_by_bilateral.pdf",
    "Description": "Cross-head transmission inherent in bone conduction (BC) hearing is one of the most important factors that limit the performance of BC binaural hearing compared to air conduction (AC) binaural hearing. In AC, cross-head transmission is imperceptible leading to a clear understanding of the nature and position of the sound source(s). In this study, the prominence of cross-head transmission in BC hearing is addressed using the fact that ipsilateral cochlear excitation can be canceled by controlled bilateral BC stimulation. A cancellation experiment was conducted on twenty participants with normal hearing at thirteen third-octave frequencies between 250 and 4000 Hz. Both stationary and transient BC stimulation at the mastoid was used. The technique employed multiple stages of masking enabling adjustments of the stimulation level and phase until the tones got canceled in the ipsilateral ear. In addition, the ear canal sound pressure was obtained for ipsilateral and contralateral BC stimulation in isolation, and with bilateral BC stimulation at perceptual cancellation. The inter-aural level differences of both the types of stimulations were found to be the same. Crosstalk was found to be the lowest around 2 kHz and the highest around 1 kHz. The unwrapped inter-aural phase difference from stationary signal cancellation showed an overall increase with frequency starting at around no difference (35\u00b0) at 250 Hz to reach 607\u00b0 at 4 kHz. Cycle-adjusted inter-aural time difference was very low (61 \u00b5s) at 250 Hz and increased to 1.1 ms at 800 Hz before falling to 0.6 ms at 4 kHz. It was also found that the ear canal sound pressure was not cancelled at the same phase as the sound in the cochlea.",

    "Filename": "A_COMPARISON_OF_THE_PERFORMANCE_OF_HRTF_MODELS_IN_.pdf",
    "Description": "Crosstalk cancellation can be used to reproduce binaural audio over loudspeakers without the use of headphones, by using inverse filtering. When designing the inverse filters, a matrix of head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) is modelled and inverted. Often in crosstalk cancellation, a free-field shadowless head model is assumed. For perfect crosstalk cancellation, the modelled HRTFs that are inverted should be identical to the physical HRTFs of the reproduction system. Mismatches between the modelled HRTFs and the physical HRTFs result in errors in the reproduced binaural signals. A range of HRTF models are reviewed and their performance in a standard crosstalk cancellation problem assessed using numerical simulations. The benefits and drawbacks of the various models are discussed and the limitations of the commonly used shadowless head model shown.",

    "Filename": "Improved_Low-Frequency_Crosstalk_Cancellation_in_B.pdf",
    "Description": "A bone conduction (BC) sound presented on either side of the head will travel to the cochleae in both ears, and this crosstalk phenomenon is considered one factor limiting the benefits of binaural hearing with BC. Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring the phase and level required for crosstalk cancellation at the cochlea; however, given a human subject&#x2019;s inability to consistently detect low frequencies, this method is limited to cancellations at frequencies above 1000 Hz. This study describes an alternative approach for implementing a crosstalk cancellation system for low frequencies by measuring ear-canal sound pressure (ECSP). Since the ear canal is close to the cochlea, we hypothesized that altering ECSP in response to a BC stimulation may be used to achieve crosstalk cancellation at the cochlea. Our approach relies on ECSP measurements to estimate impulse responses (IRs) from bone transducers to a probe microphone in the ear canal. The IRs are then used to predict the phase and level required for crosstalk cancellation at the probe microphone&#x2019;s location. To confirm the hypothesis, we measured tone reception threshold (TRT), the lowest tone level participants could detect, under two conditions: with and without crosstalk cancellation. Although crosstalk cancellation was designed to occur at the probe microphone and not at the cochlea, the TRT results showed that participants were still able to perceive cancellations at frequencies below 1000 Hz.",

    "Description": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, smart home requirements have shifted toward entertainment at home. The purpose of this research project was therefore to develop a robotic audio system for home automation. High-end audio systems normally refer to multichannel home theaters. Although multichannel audio systems enable people to enjoy surround sound as they do at the cinema, stereo audio systems have been popularly used since the 1980s. The major shortcoming of a stereo audio system is its narrow listening area. If listeners are out of the area, the system has difficulty providing a stable sound field. This is because of the head-shadow effect blocking the high-frequency sound. The proposed system, by integrating computer vision and robotics, can track the head movement of a user and adjust the directions of loudspeakers, thereby helping the sound wave travel through the air. Unlike previous studies, in which only a diminutive scenario was built, in this work, the idea was applied to a commercial 2.1 audio system, and listening tests were conducted. The theory and the simulation coincide with the experimental results. The approximate rate of audio quality improvement is 31%. The experimental results are encouraging, especially for high-pitched music.",

    "Title": "Analysis and Experiment on the Limitations of Static and Dynamic Transaural Reproduction with Two Frontal Loudspeakers",
    "Authors": "Lulu Liu, Bosun Xie",
    "Filename": "Analysis_and_Experiment_on_the_Limitations_of_Stat.pdf",
    "Description": "By duplicating the binaural pressures of an actual source, transaural reproduction with two frontal loudspeakers is expected to recreate a virtual source in arbitrary direction. However, experiments indicated that in static transaural reproduction, the perceived virtual source is usually limited to the frontalhorizontal plane. The reasons for this limitation, as guessed, are that, in static reproduction, the dynamic cues for front-back and vertical localisation are incorrect, and the high-frequency spectral cues are unstable with head movement. To validate this hypothesis, the variations of ITD (interaural time difference) caused by head turning in both static and dynamic transaural reproductions are analysed. The results indicate that dynamic reproduction is able to create appropriate low-frequency ITD variations, and the static transaural reproduction is unable to do so. Psychoacoustic experiments are conducted to compare virtual source localisation in static and dynamic reproductions. The results indicate that dynamic reproduction is able to recreate the front, back, and vertical virtual source for low-pass stimuli below 3 kHz, while for full audible bandwidth stimulus, appropriate low-frequency dynamic cue and unstable high-frequency spectral cues in dynamic reproduction result in two splitting virtual sources.",

    "Description": "To provide listeners with an immersive listening experience, binaural rendering technology has become an important research topic, especially with the rising prominence of virtual/augmented reality in recent years. In this paper, we introduce our recent works on binaural rendering technology over headphones and loudspeakers. The first work is on crosstalk cancellation (CTC), which is critical for loudspeaker-based binaural rendering. An improved free-field CTC method is first presented, in which the head effects are formulated using an attenuation factor and a phase difference factor. A stochastic robust approximation method is then suggested to further improve its robustness against the perturbation perception caused by the listener's head movement or rotation. The second work is on elevation perception of sound images, which is critical for headphone- and loudspeaker-based binaural rendering methods. By analyzing the elevation-dependent head-related transfer function (HRTF), a parametric elevation control approach is presented in which the key perceptual cues (i.e., spectral peaks and notches) are modeled using digital filters and controlled according to learned rules. The effectiveness and performance of the suggested algorithms are verified by subjective and objective experiments.",
