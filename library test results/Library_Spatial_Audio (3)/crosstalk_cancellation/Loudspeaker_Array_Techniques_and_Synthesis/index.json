    "Description": "Este artigo apresenta o desenvolvimento de uma pesquisa em grava\u00e7\u00e3o e reprodu\u00e7\u00e3o de \u00e1udio imersivo multicanal ocorrida de 2016 a 2020 na Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Brasil), que resultou em arranjos circulares de transdutores (microfones e caixas ac\u00fasticas) espa\u00e7ados em segmentos iguais. A mesma tecnologia de capta\u00e7\u00e3o sonora multicanal imersiva j\u00e1 havia sido formulada em 1991 pelo engenheiro de som Michael Williams. Por caminhos distintos, os dois estudos chegaram a um resultado comum. Reconhecendo o m\u00e9rito do achado a Williams, detalha-se, neste artigo, o percurso da pesquisa brasileira, com coment\u00e1rios complementares que ilustram a pot\u00eancia e a riqueza dos fen\u00f4menos envolvidos na solu\u00e7\u00e3o do problema. Tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o apresentados os desdobramentos do produto inicial, notadamente o desenvolvimento de uma ferramenta de simula\u00e7\u00e3o ac\u00fastica e auraliza\u00e7\u00e3o com aplica\u00e7\u00f5es em artes, comunica\u00e7\u00e3o, bioac\u00fastica, ecologia e monitoramento ambiental. Ao final apresentamos composi\u00e7\u00f5es musicais em \u00e1udio espacial destacando as facilidades expressivas dos novos recursos desenvolvidos.",

    "Description": "Spatial decomposition techniques can help to compensate for some of the limitations of higher order Ambisonics (HOA).Compared to HOA, higher order spatial impulse response rendering (HO-SIRR) has proven to substantially increase the sweet spot of a simulated space.For HO-SIRR-simulated scenes, it has also been shown that the performance of hearing aid beamformers is closer to the performance in real acoustic environments, and that interaural time and level differences are more similar to those recorded with an artificial head (KEMAR) in the original space than with a simulation based on simple HOA.However, with spatial decomposition techniques, it is more difficult to simulate sources at various distances, especially when trying to simulate focused sources within a loudspeaker array.In this presentation, we describe a near-field source rendering technique.HOA and hearing aid recordings were made in a reference room.The method presented in this paper was compared to HOA and HO-SIRR methods in a sound reproduction room, with regard to direct-toreverberant ratio (DRR), coherence, and performance of the hearing aid beamformer.",

    "Filename": "The_Effects_of_Individualized_Binaural_Room_Transf.pdf",
    "Description": "The extent to which the performance of personal sound zone (PSZ) reproduction systems is impacted by the individualization of Binaural Room Transfer Functions (BRTFs) and the coupling between the listeners' BRTFs was investigated experimentally.Such knowledge can be valuable for deriving rules for the design of high-performance, robust PSZ systems.The performance of a PSZ system consisting of eight frontal mid-range loudspeakers was objectively evaluated with PSZ filters designed using individualized BRTFs of a human listener and generic ones measured from a mannequin head, in terms of Inter-Zone Isolation, Inter-Program Isolation, and robustness against slight head misalignments.It was found that when no misalignments were introduced, Inter-Zone Isolation and Inter-Program Isolation are improved by an average of around 4 dB at all frequencies between 200 and 7,000 Hz by the individualized filters, compared to the generic ones.With constrained head misalignments, the robustness of both filters decreases as the frequency increases, and although the individualized filters maintain higher performance, their robustness above 2 kHz is lower than that of the generic ones.The evaluation also reveals an inter-listener BRTF coupling effect and a detrimental impact on the performance for both listeners when a single listener's BRTF is mismatched.",

    "Filename": "Design,_Control,_and_Evaluation_of_Mixed-Order,_Co.pdf",
    "Description": "Abstract Beamforming on the icosahedral loudspeaker (IKO), a compact, spherical loudspeaker array, was recently established and investigated as an instrument to produce auditory sculptures (i.e., 3-D sonic imagery) in electroacoustic music. Sound beams in the horizontal plane most effectively and expressively produce auditory objects via lateral reflections on sufficiently close walls and baffles. Can there be 3-D-printable arrays at drastically reduced cost and transducer count, but with similarly strong directivity in the horizontal plane? To find out, we adopt mixed-order Ambisonics schemes to control fewer, and predominantly horizontal, beam patterns, and we propose the 3|9|3 array as a suitable design, with beamforming crossing over to Ambisonics panning at high frequencies. Analytic models and measurements on hardware prototypes permit a comparison between the new design and the IKO regarding beamforming capacity. Moreover, we evaluate our 15-channel 3|9|3 prototype in listening experiments to find out whether the sculptural qualities and auditory object trajectories it produces are comparable to those of the 20-channel IKO.",

    "Description": "Introduction : Surrounding spherical loudspeaker arrays facilitate the application of various spatial audio reproduction methods and can be used for a broad range of acoustic measurements and perceptual evaluations. Methods : Installed in an anechoic chamber, the design and implementation of such an array of 68 coaxial loudspeakers, sampling a spherical cap with a radius of 1.35 m on an equal-area grid, is presented. A network-based audio backbone enables low-latency signal transmission with low-noise amplifiers providing a high signal-to-noise ratio. To address batch-to-batch variations, the loudspeaker transfer functions were equalised by individually designed 512-taps finite impulse response filters. Time delays and corresponding level adjustments further helped to minimise radial mounting imperfections. Results : The equalised loudspeaker transfer functions measured under ideal conditions and when mounted, their directivity patterns, and in-situ background noise levels satisfy key criteria towards applicability. Advantages and shortcomings of the selected decoders for panning-based techniques, as well as the influence of loudspeaker positioning errors, are analysed in terms of simulated performance metrics. An evaluation of the achievable channel separation allows deriving recommendations of feasible subset layouts for loudspeaker-based binaural reproduction. Conclusion : The combination of electroacoustic properties, simulated sound field synthesis performance and measured channel separation classifies the system as suitable for its target applications.",
