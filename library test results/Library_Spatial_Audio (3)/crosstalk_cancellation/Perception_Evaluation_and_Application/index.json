    "Description": "A well-known issue in clinical audiology and hearing research is the level of abstraction of traditional experimental assessments and methods, which lack ecological validity and differ significantly from real-life experiences, often resulting in unreliable outcomes.Attempts to deal with this matter by, for example, performing experiments in real-life contexts, can be problematic due to the difficulty of accurately identifying control-specific parameters and events.Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) have the potential to provide dynamic and immersive audiovisual experiences that are at the same time realistic and highly controllable.Several successful attempts have been made to create and validate VR-based implementations of standard audiological and linguistic tests, as well as to design procedures and technologies to assess meaningful and ecologically-valid data.Similarly, new viewpoints on auditory perception have been provided by looking at hearing training and auditory sensory augmentation, aiming at improving perceptual skills in tasks such as speech understanding and sound-source localisation.",

    "Title": "The Availability of a Hidden Real Reference Affects the Plausibility of Position-Dynamic Auditory AR",
    "Authors": "Annika Neidhardt, Anna Maria Zerlik",
    "Filename": "The_Availability_of_a_Hidden_Real_Reference_Affect.pdf",
    "Description": "This study examines the plausibility of Auditory Augmented Reality (AAR) realized with position-dynamic binaural synthesis over headphones. An established method to evaluate the plausibility of AAR asks participants to decide whether they are listening to the virtual or real version of the sound object. To date, this method has only been used to evaluate AAR systems for seated listeners. The AAR realization examined in this study instead allows listeners to turn to arbitrary directions and walk towards, past, and away from a real loudspeaker that reproduced sound only virtually. The experiment was conducted in two parts. In the first part, the subjects were asked whether they are listening to the real or the virtual version, not knowing that it was always the virtual version. In the second part, the real versions of the scenes where the loudspeaker actually reproduced sound were added. Two different source positions, three different test stimuli, and two different sound levels were considered. Seventeen volunteers, including five experts, participated. In the first part, none of the participants noticed that the virtual reproduction was active throughout the different test scenes. The inexperienced listeners tended to accept the virtual reproduction as real, while experts distributed their answers approximately equally. In the second part, experts could identify the virtual version quite reliably. For inexperienced listeners, the individual results varied enormously. Since the presence of the headphones influences the perception of the real sound field, this shadowing effect had to be considered in the creation of the virtual sound source as well. This requirement still limits test methods considering the real version in its ecological validity. Although the results indicate that the availability of a hidden real reference leads to a more critical evaluation, it is crucial to be aware that the presence of the headphones slightly distorts the reference. This issue seems more vital to the plausibility estimates achieved with this evaluation method than the increased freedom in motion.",

    "Description": "We present a real-time bidirectional communication system that lets two people, separated by distance, experience a face-to-face conversation as if they were copresent. It is the first telepresence system that is demonstrably better than 2D videoconferencing, as measured using participant ratings (e.g., presence, attentiveness, reaction-gauging, engagement), meeting recall, and observed nonverbal behaviors (e.g., head nods, eyebrow movements). This milestone is reached by maximizing audiovisual fidelity and the sense of copresence in all design elements, including physical layout, lighting, face tracking, multi-view capture, microphone array, multi-stream compression, loudspeaker output, and lenticular display. Our system achieves key 3D audiovisual cues (stereopsis, motion parallax, and spatialized audio) and enables the full range of communication cues (eye contact, hand gestures, and body language), yet does not require special glasses or body-worn microphones/headphones. The system consists of a head-tracked autostereoscopic display, high-resolution 3D capture and rendering subsystems, and network transmission using compressed color and depth video streams. Other contributions include a novel image-based geometry fusion algorithm, free-space dereverberation, and talker localization.",

    "Description": "Many hearing difficulties can be explained as a loss of audibility, a problem easily detected and treated using standard audiological procedures. Yet, hearing can be much poorer (or more impaired) than audibility predicts because of deficits in the suprathreshold mechanisms that encode the rapidly changing, spectral, temporal, and binaural aspects of the sound. The ability to evaluate these mechanisms requires well-defined stimuli and strict adherence to rigorous psychometric principles. This project reports on the comparison between a laboratory-based and a mobile system\u2019s results for psychoacoustic assessment in adult listeners with normal hearing. A description of both systems employed is provided. Psychoacoustic tests include frequency discrimination, amplitude modulation detection, binaural encoding, and temporal gap detection. Results reported by the mobile system were not significantly different from those collected with the laboratory-based system for most of the tests and were consistent with those reported in the literature. The mobile system has the potential to be a feasible option for the assessment of suprathreshold auditory encoding abilities.",

    "Description": "The integration of virtual acoustic environments (VAEs) with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) offers novel avenues to investigate behavioral and neural processes of speech-in-noise (SIN) comprehension in complex auditory scenes. Particularly in children with hearing aids (HAs), the combined application might offer new insights into the neural mechanism of SIN perception in simulated real-life acoustic scenarios. Here, we present first pilot data from six children with normal hearing (NH) and three children with bilateral HAs to explore the potential applicability of this novel approach. Children with NH received a speech recognition benefit from low room reverberation and target-distractors\u2019 spatial separation, particularly when the pitch of the target and the distractors was similar. On the neural level, the left inferior frontal gyrus appeared to support SIN comprehension during effortful listening. Children with HAs showed decreased SIN perception across conditions. The VAE-fNIRS approach is critically compared to traditional SIN assessments. Although the current study shows that feasibility still needs to be improved, the combined application potentially offers a promising tool to investigate novel research questions in simulated real-life listening. Future modified VAE-fNIRS applications are warranted to replicate the current findings and to validate its application in research and clinical settings.",
