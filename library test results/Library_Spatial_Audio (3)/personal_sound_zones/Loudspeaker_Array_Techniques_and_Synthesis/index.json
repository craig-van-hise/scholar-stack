    "Description": "Immersive and spatial sound reproduction has been widely studied using loudspeaker arrays. However, flat-panel loudspeakers that utilize thin flat panels with force actuators are a promising alternative to traditional coaxial loudspeakers for practical applications, with benefits in low-visual profiles and diffuse radiation. Literature has addressed the sound quality and applications of flat-panel loudspeakers in three-dimensional sound reproduction, such as wave field synthesis and sound zones. This paper revisits the spatial sound perception of flat-panel loudspeakers, specifically the localization mismatch between the perceived and desired sound directions when using amplitude panning. Subjective tests in an anechoic chamber with 24 subjects result in the mean azimuth direction mismatch within \u00b16.0\u00b0 and the mean elevation mismatch within \u00b110.0\u00b0. The experimental results show that the virtual source created by amplitude panning over a flat-panel loudspeaker still achieves spatial localization accuracy close to that of a real sound source, despite not using complex algorithms or acoustic transfer function information. The findings of this study establish a benchmark for virtual source localization in spatial sound reproduction using flat-panel loudspeakers, which can serve as a starting point for future research and optimization of algorithms.",

    "Authors": "Jesper Brunnstr\u00f6m, Toon van Waterschoot, Marc Moonen",
    "Filename": "Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise_Ratio_Based_Opti.pdf",
    "Description": "Sound zone control is posed as an optimization problem where finite impulse response control filters are jointly optimized for low transmit power, while maintaining a sufficiently high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in all zones. This problem statement in particular allows the consideration of sound zone control under the additional influence of external noise, which is rarely taken into account and indeed necessitates an alternative problem statement. In addition, the spectral characteristics of the audio signals are taken into account, both for the transmit power minimization and computing the SINR. The optimization problem is shown to be solved optimally by semidefinite relaxation, but the computational cost is high. An alternate method is proposed, inspired by a duality between transmit and receive beamforming commonly exploited in digital communications. A virtual receive optimization problem for sound zone control is derived, and it is shown to have the same optimal solution as the original transmit optimization problem. The receive optimization problem is solved efficiently through a fixed point iteration algorithm. The two proposed methods are compared against acoustic contrast control in a simulated reverberant environment, where it is shown that the proposed methods require less transmit power to produce similar SINRs.",

    "Title": "Meta-Speaker: Acoustic Source Projection by Exploiting Air Nonlinearity",
    "Authors": "Weiguo Wang, Yuan He, Meng Jin, Y. Z. Sun, Xiuzhen Guo",
    "Filename": "Meta-Speaker_Acoustic_Source_Projection_by_Exploit.pdf",
    "Description": "This paper proposes Meta-Speaker, an innovative speaker capable of projecting audible sources into the air with a high level of manipulability. Unlike traditional speakers that emit sound waves in all directions, Meta-Speaker can manipulate the granularity of the audible region, down to a single point, and can manipulate the location of the source. Additionally, the source projected by Meta-Speaker is a physical presence in space, allowing both humans and machines to perceive it with spatial awareness. Meta-Speaker achieves this by leveraging the fact that air is a nonlinear medium, which enables the reproduction of audible sources from ultrasounds. Meta-Speaker comprises two distributed ultrasonic arrays, each transmitting a narrow ultrasonic beam. The audible source can be reproduced at the intersection of the beams. We present a comprehensive profiling of Meta-Speaker to validate the high manipulability it offers. We prototype Meta-Speaker and demonstrate its potential through three applications: anchor-free localization with a median error of 0.13 m, location-aware communication with a throughput of 1.28 Kbps, and acoustic augmented reality where users can perceive source direction with a mean error of 9.8 degrees.",

    "Authors": "Letizia Chisari, Gianluca Memoli, Andrew Philippides",
    "Filename": "TOWARD_ABERRATIONS_CORRECTION_IN_AUDIO_SYSTEMS_WIT.pdf",
    "Description": "Immersive audio is crucial for immersive experiences, but the tools aiming to deliver it to the listeners are still limited to headphones and bulky loudspeaker arrays.In this paper, we discuss the possibility of using a single loudspeaker, whose emission is augmented coupling acoustic metamaterial lenses with it, to obtain sound field control and thus to deliver localized sound cues in a 2D environment around a listener.Together with the sound field control, the reduction of the form-factor of the system is obtained.In fact, the realization of personal sound zones typically require at least 13 loudspeakers, placed around the listener but metamaterials have already proven that they can contribute to obtain more compact and lighter audio systems, allowing an effective directivity control and cancelling emissions in unwanted directions and thus, contributing to deliver the intended acoustic field in the region of interest.Just like an optical objective made of only two lenses, however, it was recently found that such a system suffers from the acoustic equivalent of spherical aberration.In this work, inspired by optics, we use numerical methods to design an additional metasurface to passively correct this aberration.Perspectives of combining systems of multiple lenses to correct audio systems will be discussed.",

    "Authors": "Kasper Fangel Skov, Peter Axel Nielsen, Jesper Kjeldskov",
    "Filename": "Tuning_Shared_Hospital_Spaces_Sound_Zones_in_Healt.pdf",
    "Description": "The problem of noise in hospitals is commonly tackled through noise abatement practices, which consider 'quietness' as a quality indicator. However, the influence of positive or negative subjective reactions to these sounds are rarely examined. Recent efforts emphasize the importance of considering the benefits of wanted sound while minimizing unwanted noise to reach a positive healthcare soundscape. The authors identified sound zones in shared hospital spaces as a means to achieve this through sound separation, noise masking and designed sound zone content. Listening evaluations were conducted to evaluate subjective responses of individuals from hearing a hospital soundscape across a variety of sound zone interventions. The authors conclude that sound zone interventions in shared hospital spaces offer subjective benefits that move beyond noise reduction. As an area for future work, sound zone interventions will be deployed in hospital settings to study potential long-term restorative effects on patients and better working conditions for staff.",

    "Title": "Amplitude Matching for Multizone Sound Field Control",
    "Authors": "Takumi Abe, Shoichi Koyama, Natsuki Ueno, Hiroshi Saruwatari",
    "Filename": "Amplitude_Matching_for_Multizone_Sound_Field_Contr.pdf",
    "Description": "A multizone sound field control method, called amplitude matching, is proposed. The objective of amplitude matching is to synthesize a desired amplitude (or magnitude) distribution over a target region with multiple loudspeakers, whereas the phase distribution is arbitrary. Most of the current multizone sound field control methods are intended to synthesize a specific sound field including phase or to control acoustic potential energy inside the target region. In amplitude matching, a specific desired amplitude distribution can be set, ignoring sound propagation directions. Although the optimization problem of amplitude matching does not have a closed-form solution, our proposed algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) allows us to accurately and efficiently synthesize the desired amplitude distribution. We also introduce the differential-norm penalty for a time-domain filter design with a small filter length. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method outperforms current multizone sound field control methods in terms of accuracy of the synthesized amplitude distribution.",

    "Authors": "Sangwoo Ha, Jungwoo Kim, Hyun-guk Kim, Semyung Wang",
    "Filename": "Horizontal_Active_Noise_Control_Based_on_Wave_Fiel.pdf",
    "Description": "In this paper, we propose horizontal active noise control (ANC) using two-dimensional wave field information alone. By reducing the control space to a horizontal plane, the number of microphones and speakers was considerably reduced compared with ANC systems using three-dimensional wave field information. The radii of the reference, microphone, and loudspeaker array were determined based on the wave field reproduction error. Accordingly, the simulation and experimental results of the proposed ANC system were presented based on the use of five microphones and loudspeakers using conventional ANC algorithms. Overall, an average noise reduction of 20 dB was observed inside the microphone array with a radius of 0.5 m for tonal noise at 200 Hz. This performance is acceptable with a drastically reduced number of microphones and speakers. The findings of this study, along with further research conducted in a reverberant room, represent a significant contribution to global ANC commercialization.",

    "Filename": "Weighted_pressure_matching_with_windowed_targets_f.pdf",
    "Description": "Personal sound zones (PSZ) systems use an array of loudspeakers to render independent audio signals to multiple listeners within a room. The performance of a PSZ system, designed using weighted pressure matching, depends on the selected target responses for the bright zone. In reverberant environments, the target responses are generally chosen to be the room impulse responses from one of the loudspeakers to the control points in the selected bright zone. This approach synthesizes the direct propagation component and all the reverberant components in the bright zone, while minimizing the energy in the dark zone. We present a theoretical analysis to show that high energy differences cannot be achieved for the diffuse reverberant components in the bright and dark zones, and so trying to synthesize these components in the bright zone does not lead to the best performance. It is then shown that the performance can be improved by using windowed versions of these measured impulse responses as target signals, in order to control which reverberant components are synthesized in the bright zone and which are not. This observation is supported by experimental measurements in two scenarios with different levels of reverberation.",

    "Filename": "Large-scale_outdoor_sound_field_control.pdf",
    "Description": "The feasibility and the performance of controlling low frequency sound of loudspeaker systems under varying atmospheric conditions is examined experimentally. In the experiment, a control subwoofer array is canceling the sound of a primary subwoofer array over long distances (\u223c100 m) and in large areas (\u223c320 m2) using the pressure-matching method. To avoid the measurement of the sound field over the entire control area, a sound propagation model is introduced that is fitted in situ to model the radiation properties of the loudspeakers and the variation of the speed of sound. The results show that the control system reduces the sound pressure levels by up to 15\u201320 dB over the subwoofers' frequency range. However, the reduction can vary considerably depending on the specific atmospheric condition. The model-based approach reduces the number of required measurements and achieves similar reduction performance to the control based on direct measurements with considerably fewer microphone locations while also being more robust. Additionally, the sound propagation model enables the reduction of acoustic energy in virtual control zones that are far away from the microphone location. The investigated methodology has a direct application in the mitigation of sound from outdoor concerts.",

    "Description": "Personal audio refers to the generation of spatially distinct sound zones that allow individuals within a shared space to listen to their own audio material without affecting, or being affected, by others. Recent interest in such systems has focussed on their performance in public spaces where speech privacy is desirable. To achieve this goal, speech is focussed towards the target listener and a masking signal is focussed into the area where the target speech signal could otherwise be overheard. An effective masking signal must substantially reduce the intelligibility in this region without becoming an annoyance to those nearby. To assess these perceptual requirements, listening tests were carried out using two examples of loudspeaker arrays with different spatial aliasing characteristics, to determine the impacts of different masking signal spectra on speech intelligibility and subjective preference. The results of these tests were used, alongside objective and subjective metrics, to form a design specification for private personal audio systems.",
