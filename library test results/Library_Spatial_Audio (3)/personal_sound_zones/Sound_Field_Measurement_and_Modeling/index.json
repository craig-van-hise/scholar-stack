    "Description": "Impulse responses (IRs) estimation of multi-input acoustic systems is a prerequisite for many audio applications. In this paper, an adaptive identification problem based on the Autostep algorithm is extended to the simultaneous estimation of room IRs for multiple input single output linear time invariant systems without any a priori information. To do so, the proposed algorithm is initially evaluated in a simulated room with several sound sources active at the same time. Finally, an experimental validation is proposed for the cases of a semi-anechoic chamber and an arbitrary room. Special attention is dedicated to the algorithm convergence behavior, considering different meta parameters settings. Results are eventually compared with the other normalized version of the least mean square algorithm.",

    "Filename": "Room_Impulse_Response_Reconstuction_using_Physics-.pdf",
    "Description": "In this paper, we present a method for reconstructing the sound field in a room using physics-informed neural networks.Our approach employs a limited set of room impulse responses as training data for the network, while also incorporating the fundamental physical principles of sound propagation in space through the use of the wave equation.This allows the network to not only learn the underlying physics of sound propagation but also utilize the nonlinear mapping capabilities of neural networks to adjust for any inhomogeneities in the room and measurement artifacts.Furthermore, the network can determine particle velocity and intensity through the use of autodifferentiation.The results indicate the effectiveness of the approach in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency.This work presents a promising approach for sound field reconstruction and has potential for improving the representation of sound fields in various acoustic settings, including rooms and other complex environments, particularly for the synthesis of room impulse responses.",
