# ScholarStack: Your AI Research Librarian

**ScholarStack** is an intelligent, AI-driven automation pipeline that acts as a digital librarian for building comprehensive academic libraries. It retrieves, reads, and organizes research papers, transforming a simple query into a **structured, downloadable library** categorized by AI.

## 🚀 Features

* **Omni-Channel Search**: Your librarian leverages **OpenAlex** to query a massive global index of research papers, utilizing **Unpaywall** to resolve open-access PDF links.
* **Topic Expansion**: Uses **Google Gemini** to generate intelligent search verticals (e.g., "Spatial Audio" -> "Ambisonics", "Binaural") to find papers that keyword matching often misses.
* **Smart Retrieval**: Aggressively acquires PDFs and validates file headers to ensure you receive high-quality, readable documents. Uses parallel processing for max speed.
* **Strict Taxonomy**: Powered by **Google Gemini**, the agent reads abstracts and organizes papers into precise, technical sub-fields (e.g., "Ambisonics" instead of "General Audio").
* **Search History & Persistence**: The app "remembers" your settings between sessions. A **Mission Log** lets you review and reload past search configurations instantly.
* **Curated Packaging**: Packages your research into a **downloadable ZIP file** or syncs it directly to **Google Drive**.
* **Modern Interface**: A Streamlit web app with **Research Modes** (Fast vs. Deep), sortable history, and granular controls.
* **Storage Management**: Automatically manages disk space by cleaning up old missions and serving large files efficiently.

---

---

## 📂 Project Structure

*   **`src/`**: Core application code (`app.py`, pipelines).
*   **`data/`**: Application state (`search_history.json`, `user_settings.json`), search cache, and `Library/` output.
*   **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts for verification and debugging (e.g., `verify_density.py`).
*   **`tests/`**: Unit tests and test data.
*   **`PRPs/`**: Product Requirements Prompts (Feature backlog).

## 📂 The "Stacked" Output

ScholarStack organizes your research into a clean, logical structure. Whether you download the **ZIP** or sync to **Drive**, you get:

```text
Library_Topic_Name/
├── Catalog_Summary.md          # A master manifest (includes Search Settings, Date Range, Sort Method)
├── Keyword_Folder/             # (Optional) Segregated by your specific search term
│   ├── Category_A/             # Precise AI Cluster (e.g., "Diffraction Modeling")
│   │   ├── paper_1.pdf
│   │   └── index.json          # Metadata
│   └── Category_B/             # (e.g., "Binaural Rendering")
│       └── paper_2.pdf
└── ...

```

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+**
2. **Google Cloud Project (for Auth & Drive Sync):**
* Create a project at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com).
* Enable **Google Drive API**.
* Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials (Web Application).
* Download the JSON and save it as `client_secrets.json` in the project root.


3. **Gemini API Key (Optional but Recommended):**
* Get a free key from [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).
* **Important:** Ensure your key is in a `.env` file as `GOOGLE_API_KEY=...`. The system is configured to prioritize this file over shell variables to prevent key exhaustion errors.



### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/craig-van-hise/scholar-stack.git
cd scholar-stack
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

---

## 💻 Running the Web App

To launch the interface:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && streamlit run src/app.py

```

* **Search & Curate**: Enter your topic and watch the librarian agent work in real-time.
* **Export**: Once the pipeline completes, download the organized **ZIP file** or click to sync the folder to your **Google Drive**.
* **AI Power**: Add your Gemini API Key in the "Settings" sidebar to enable the intelligent folder categorization.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* **Data Privacy**: ScholarStack processes data locally and only exports to Google Drive if authorized.
* **Storage**: The app manages a local cache of recent missions. Older missions are automatically cleaned up to save space.
* **Rate Limits**: Includes automatic backoff for Semantic Scholar to prevent API interruptions.

# Project Status Report

**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Status:** Operational / Polished
**Current Phase:** Final Verification & Documentation

## Executive Summary
**ScholarStack** is now a robust, user-aligned research agent with a strictly organized codebase. We have refined the **Taxonomy Logic** (Per-Keyword), overhauled the **Search History UI**, and formally refactored the project structure into modular directories (`src`, `data`, `scripts`, `tests`). Recent additions include a **Fast Mode** for rapid research and a **Storage Management System** to handle large datasets efficiently.

## Implemented Architecture

### 1. The Omni-Search Module (`src/1_search_omni.py`)
*   **Search Verticals:** Successfully creates 15+ sub-topic queries (e.g. "Spatial Audio" -> "HRTF", "Ambisonics").
*   **Parallel Processing:** Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` for high-speed OpenAlex querying.
*   **Metadata Capture:** Captures `Citation_Count` and maps Search Verticals to results.

### 2. The Interface (`src/app.py`)
*   **Research Modes:** Toggle between "Fast Mode" (Direct Download, ~15m) and "Deep Mode" (Full AI Clustering, ~90m).
*   **Persistence:** Automatically saves state to `data/user_settings.json`.
*   **Search History V2:** Multi-row selection table with explicit "Load" and "Delete" actions. History stored in `data/search_history.json`.
*   **Structure:** Code explicitly separated from data.

### 3. Core Pipeline (`src/2_cluster_taxonomy.py`)
*   **Per-Keyword Taxonomy:** AI categorization runs *per Search Vertical* for higher relevance.
*   **Count Stability:** Buffer logic (`Limit * 2`) prevents "Musical Chairs" paper loss.
*   **Paths:** Scripts auto-detect input/output paths in `data/` if running manually.

## Recent Accomplishments
*   **Fast Mode:** Implemented a high-speed research option that bypasses AI clustering for quick results.
*   **Storage Management:** Added automated cleanup of old missions and large file handling (serving direct downloads from disk) to prevent server crashes.
*   **Project Refactor:** Cleaned root directory. Moved source code to `src/`, data to `data/`, tools to `scripts/`.
*   **UI Polish:** "Zombie Modal" fixed. Search History uses native multi-select and persistent resizing.

## Technical Notes
*   **Launch Command:** `source .venv/bin/activate && streamlit run src/app.py`
*   **Data Storage:** All generated files (Library, CSVs, Cache) now reside in `data/`.

If you broaden your criteria to include papers that merely *mention* these terms rather than focusing on them as a primary topic, the number rises to the **low thousands (1,000+)**.

Here is the breakdown of where these papers are located and examples of what you will find.

### 1. Approximate Count by Source

* **arXiv.org (Preprints):** ~50–100 papers. These are often the most recent (2020–2025) and frequently include links to code or datasets.
* **ResearchGate (Author-Uploaded):** ~200+ papers. Many authors upload the "accepted version" of their IEEE or AES papers here for free public access.
* **University Repositories:** ~100+ papers. Universities with strong audio labs (like the University of Southampton or Princeton) often host their PhD theses and conference papers publicly.

### 2. Selected Open Source/Access Papers Found

Here are five concrete examples of papers found during this search that you can read immediately for free:

* **"Spatial Audio Empowered Smart Speakers with Xblock" (2023)**
* *Topic:* A pose-adaptive crosstalk cancellation algorithm for free-moving users.
* *Source:* arXiv / ResearchGate


* **"Optimal Crosstalk Cancellation for Binaural Audio with Two Loudspeakers"**
* *Topic:* Theoretical analysis of the "sweet spot" and filter design for two-speaker setups.
* *Source:* Princeton University / Semantic Scholar


* **"Investigation on a Crosstalk Cancellation Algorithm for Binaural Audio Headrest" (2025)**
* *Topic:* Applying crosstalk cancellation specifically to headrests in cars to create immersive audio without headphones.
* *Source:* ResearchGate (Journal of the Audio Engineering Society draft)


* **"Towards Faster Continuous Multi-Channel HRTF Measurements Based on Learning System Models" (2021)**
* *Topic:* While focused on HRTF, this paper explicitly discusses crosstalk cancellation for loudspeaker reproduction and includes links to **code and data**.
* *Source:* arXiv:2110.03630


* **"Crosstalk Cancellation in Virtual Acoustic Imaging Systems for Multiple Listeners"**
* *Topic:* Addressing the difficult problem of canceling crosstalk for more than one person at a time.
* *Source:* University of Southampton (ISVR)



### 3. "Open Source" vs. "Open Access"

* **Open Access (Papers):** As noted above, there are hundreds of free PDFs available.
* **Open Source (Code):** Actual *code* implementations are rarer. However, papers on **arXiv** are your best bet. Look for papers titled "Reproducible research" or those with a "GitHub" link in the abstract.
* *Tip:* Search GitHub for "Crosstalk Cancellation" directly. You will find roughly **10–20 repositories** (mostly Python and MATLAB implementations) that correspond to these research papers.



### 4. How to Find Them (Search Strings)

To access these specific papers, use these targeted search strings in Google or Google Scholar:

* **For PDFs:** `filetype:pdf "spatial audio" "crosstalk cancellation"`
* **For arXiv specifically:** `site:arxiv.org "spatial audio" "crosstalk cancellation"`
* **For Code:** `site:github.com "crosstalk cancellation" audio`

FILE: # Guide to OpenAlex parameters.md
==================================================
In the context of the OpenAlex API, "args" are the **query parameters** you append to the URL (e.g., `?search=...&filter=...`).

Because OpenAlex is a REST API, these arguments are universal across all endpoints (Works, Authors, Sources, etc.), but the *values* they accept change depending on what you are searching.

Here is the complete reference guide to the input arguments, categorized by function.

---

### **1. The "Big Six" Control Arguments**

These are the top-level parameters you will use to control *what* you get back and *how* it looks.

| Argument | Purpose | Example Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`search`** | The "Google" bar. Searches titles, abstracts, and full text. | `?search=generative+ai` |
| **`filter`** | Precise constraints. The most powerful argument (see §2). | `?filter=is_oa:true,year:2024` |
| **`select`** | Limits the response fields (reduces JSON size/latency). | `?select=id,title,doi` |
| **`sort`** | Controls the order of results. | `?sort=cited_by_count:desc` |
| **`per-page`** | Number of results per request (Max: 200). | `?per-page=200` |
| **`page`** | Pagination (Works for the first 10k results). | `?page=2` |

---

### **2. Deep Dive: The `filter` Argument**

The `filter` argument is a container for dozens of specific "keys." You verify these by appending them as a comma-separated string: `filter=key1:value1,key2:value2`.

**Common Filter Keys for Papers (Works):**

| Category | Filter Key | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access** | `is_oa` | `true`/`false`. Is the paper free to read? |
|  | `has_doi` | `true`/`false`. Does it have a valid DOI? |
|  | `open_access.oa_status` | `gold`, `green`, `bronze`, `hybrid`. |
| **Dates** | `publication_year` | E.g., `2023` or `>2020` (ranges supported). |
|  | `from_publication_date` | `2023-01-01` (Specific start date). |
|  | `to_publication_date` | `2023-12-31` (Specific end date). |
| **Impact** | `cited_by_count` | `>100`. Papers with high citations. |
|  | `has_fulltext` | `true`. Works where OpenAlex indexed the full text. |
| **Identity** | `authorships.author.id` | Search for a specific author by OpenAlex ID. |
|  | `primary_location.source.id` | Search for a specific Journal/Conference ID. |
|  | `institutions.id` | Search for papers from a specific university. |
| **Content** | `type` | `article`, `book-chapter`, `dissertation`. |
|  | `language` | `en`, `fr`, `zh`, etc. |

---

### **3. Deep Dive: The `search` Argument**

While `?search=` searches everything, you can also be surgical by attaching `.search` to specific fields within the filter parameter (a common "power user" trick).

* **Standard:** `?search=dna` (Searches title, abstract, and full text).
* **Title Only:** `?filter=title.search:dna` (Ignores mentions in the abstract).
* **Abstract Only:** `?filter=abstract.search:dna` (Only looks inside the abstract).
* **Affiliation:** `?filter=raw_affiliation_string.search:harvard` (Finds strings like "Harvard Medical School").

---

### **4. Advanced & Utility Arguments**

These are less common but critical for specific scraping tasks.

| Argument | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **`cursor`** | **Critical for Deep Scraping.** Used instead of `page` to retrieve >10,000 results. You pass the `next_cursor` string returned in the previous API response. |
| **`sample`** | Returns a random sample of  papers. `?sample=50`. Great for testing pipelines. |
| **`seed`** | Used with `sample`. Ensures the "random" sample is the same every time you run it (reproducibility). |
| **`group_by`** | Returns summary statistics instead of a list of papers. E.g., `?group_by=publication_year` returns a count of papers per year. |
| **`mailto`** | Not a query param, but **highly recommended**. Add `&mailto=your@email.com` to get into the "polite pool" (faster response times). |

### **5. Valid Sort Options**

You can sort by almost any numerical or date field. Add `:desc` (descending) or `:asc` (ascending).

* `relevance_score` (Default when searching)
* `publication_year`
* `publication_date`
* `cited_by_count` (Find the most influential papers)
* `title` (Alphabetical)

### **Example: The "Perfect" Query**

If you want **50 highly-cited Open Access papers on LLMs from 2024**, your URL inputs would look like this:

```http
https://api.openalex.org/works?
  search=Large Language Models
  &filter=is_oa:true,publication_year:2024,cited_by_count:>10
  &sort=cited_by_count:desc
  &per-page=50
  &select=id,title,open_access,cited_by_count
  &mailto=yourname@example.com

```

# Gemini AI Rules for Firebase Studio Nix Projects

## 1. Persona & Expertise

You are an expert in configuring development environments within Firebase Studio. You are proficient in using the `dev.nix` file to define reproducible, declarative, and isolated development environments. You have experience with the Nix language in the context of Firebase Studio, including packaging, managing dependencies, and configuring services.

## 2. Project Context

This project is a Nix-based environment for Firebase Studio, defined by a `.idx/dev.nix` file. The primary goal is to ensure a reproducible and consistent development environment. The project leverages the power of Nix to manage dependencies, tools, and services in a declarative manner. **Note:** This is not a Nix Flake-based environment.

## 3. `dev.nix` Configuration

The `.idx/dev.nix` file is the single source of truth for the development environment. Here are some of the most common configuration options:

### `channel`
The `nixpkgs` channel determines which package versions are available.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  channel = "stable-24.05"; # or "unstable"
}
```

### `packages`
A list of packages to install from the specified channel. You can search for packages on the [NixOS package search](https://search.nixos.org/packages).

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  packages = [
    pkgs.nodejs_20
    pkgs.go
  ];
}
```

### `env`
A set of environment variables to define within the workspace.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  env = {
    API_KEY = "your-secret-key";
  };
}
```

### `idx.extensions`
A list of VS Code extensions to install from the [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/).

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  idx = {
    extensions = [
      "vscodevim.vim"
      "golang.go"
    ];
  };
}
```

### `idx.workspace`
Workspace lifecycle hooks.

- **`onCreate`:** Runs when a workspace is first created.
- **`onStart`:** Runs every time the workspace is (re)started.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  idx = {
    workspace = {
      onCreate = {
        npm-install = "npm install";
      };
      onStart = {
        start-server = "npm run dev";
      };
    };
  };
}
```

### `idx.previews`
Configure a web preview for your application. The `$PORT` variable is dynamically assigned.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  idx = {
    previews = {
      enable = true;
      previews = {
        web = {
          command = ["npm" "run" "dev" "--" "--port" "$PORT"];
          manager = "web";
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
```

## 4. Example Setups for Common Frameworks

Here are some examples of how to configure your `dev.nix` for common languages and frameworks.

### Node.js Web Server
This example sets up a Node.js environment, installs dependencies, and runs a development server with a web preview.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  packages = [ pkgs.nodejs_20 ];
  idx = {
    extensions = [ "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint" ];
    workspace = {
      onCreate = {
        npm-install = "npm install";
      };
      onStart = {
        dev-server = "npm run dev";
      };
    };
    previews = {
      enable = true;
      previews = {
        web = {
          command = ["npm" "run" "dev" "--" "--port" "$PORT"];
          manager = "web";
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
```

### Python with Flask
This example sets up a Python environment for a Flask web server. Remember to create a `requirements.txt` file with `Flask` in it.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  packages = [ pkgs.python3 pkgs.pip ];
  idx = {
    extensions = [ "ms-python.python" ];
    workspace = {
      onCreate = {
        pip-install = "pip install -r requirements.txt";
      };
    };
    previews = {
      enable = true;
      previews = {
        web = {
          command = ["flask" "run" "--port" "$PORT"];
          manager = "web";
        };
      };
    };
  };
}
```

### Go CLI
This example sets up a Go environment for building a command-line interface.

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }: {
  packages = [ pkgs.go ];
  idx = {
    extensions = [ "golang.go" ];
    workspace = {
      onCreate = {
        go-mod = "go mod tidy";
      };
      onStart = {
        run-app = "go run .";
      };
    };
  };
}
```

## 5. Interaction Guidelines

- Assume the user is familiar with general software development concepts but may be new to Nix and Firebase Studio.
- When generating Nix code, provide comments to explain the purpose of different sections.
- Explain the benefits of using `dev.nix` for reproducibility and dependency management.
- If a request is ambiguous, ask for clarification on the desired tools, libraries, and versions to be included in the environment.
- When suggesting changes to `dev.nix`, explain the impact of the changes on the development environment and remind the user to reload the environment.

    "Authors": "Tobias Lentz, Dirk Schr\u00f6der, Michael Vorl\u00e4nder, Ingo Assenmacher",
    "Filename": "Virtual Reality System with Integrated Sound Field Simulation and Reproduction.pdf",
    "Description": "A real-time audio rendering system is introduced which combines a full room-specific simulation, dynamic crosstalk cancellation, and multitrack binaural synthesis for virtual acoustical imaging. The system is applicable for any room shape (normal, long, flat, coupled), independent of the a priori assumption of a diffuse sound field. This provides the possibility of simulating indoor or outdoor spatially distributed, freely movable sources and a moving listener in virtual environments. In addition to that, near-to-head sources can be simulated by using measured near-field HRTFs. The reproduction component consists of a headphone-free reproduction by dynamic crosstalk cancellation. The focus of the project is mainly on the integration and interaction of all involved subsystems. It is demonstrated that the system is capable of real-time room simulation and reproduction and, thus, can be used as a reliable platform for further research on VR applications.",

    "Filename": "Spatial Audio for Soundscape Design Recording and Reproduction.pdf",
    "Description": "With the advancement of spatial audio technologies, in both recording and reproduction, we are seeing more applications that incorporate 3D sound to create an immersive aural experience. Soundscape design and evaluation for urban planning can now tap into the extensive spatial audio tools for sound capture and 3D sound rendering over headphones and speaker arrays. In this paper, we outline a list of available state-of-the-art spatial audio recording techniques and devices, spatial audio physical and perceptual reproduction techniques, emerging spatial audio techniques for virtual and augmented reality, followed by a discussion on the degree of perceptual accuracy of recording and reproduction techniques in representing the acoustic environment.",

    "Filename": "Project starline.pdf",
    "Description": "We present a real-time bidirectional communication system that lets two people, separated by distance, experience a face-to-face conversation as if they were copresent. It is the first telepresence system that is demonstrably better than 2D videoconferencing, as measured using participant ratings (e.g., presence, attentiveness, reaction-gauging, engagement), meeting recall, and observed nonverbal behaviors (e.g., head nods, eyebrow movements). This milestone is reached by maximizing audiovisual fidelity and the sense of copresence in all design elements, including physical layout, lighting, face tracking, multi-view capture, microphone array, multi-stream compression, loudspeaker output, and lenticular display. Our system achieves key 3D audiovisual cues (stereopsis, motion parallax, and spatialized audio) and enables the full range of communication cues (eye contact, hand gestures, and body language), yet does not require special glasses or body-worn microphones/headphones. The system consists of a head-tracked autostereoscopic display, high-resolution 3D capture and rendering subsystems, and network transmission using compressed color and depth video streams. Other contributions include a novel image-based geometry fusion algorithm, free-space dereverberation, and talker localization.",

    "Authors": "Ben Shirley, Rob Oldfield",
    "Filename": "Clean Audio for TV broadcast An Object-Based Approach for Hearing-Impaired Viewers.pdf",
    "Description": "As the percentage of the population with hearing loss increases, broadcasters are receiving more complaints about the difficulty in understanding dialog in the presence of background sound and music. This article explores these issues, reviews previously proposed solutions, and presents an object-based approach that can be implemented within MPEG-H to give listeners control of their audio mix. An object-based approach to clean audio, combined with methods to isolate sounds that are important to the narrative and meaning of a broadcast has the potential to enable users to have complete control of the relative levels of all aspects of audio from TV broadcast. This approach was demonstrated at the University of Salford campus in 2013.",

The calculations are based on 3D meshes of listener\u2019s body parts such as the head, pinna, and torso. The numerical core of Mesh2HRTF is written in C++ and employs the boundary-element method for solving the Helmholtz equation. It is accelerated by a multilevel fast multipole method and can easily be parallelized to further speed up the computations. The recently refactored framework of Mesh2HRTF 1.x contains tools for preparing the meshes as well as specific post-processing and inspection of the calculatedHRTFs. The resultingHRTFs are saved in the spatially oriented format for acoustics being directly applicable in virtual and augmented reality applications and psychoacoustic research. The Mesh2HRTF 1.x code is automatically tested to assure high quality and reliability. A comprehensive online documentation enables easy access for users without in-depth knowledge of acoustic simulations.",

    "Title": "The Availability of a Hidden Real Reference Affects the Plausibility of Position-Dynamic Auditory AR",
    "Authors": "Annika Neidhardt, Anna Maria Zerlik",
    "Filename": "The Availability of a Hidden Real Reference Affects the Plausibility of Position-Dynamic Auditory AR.pdf",
    "Description": "This study examines the plausibility of Auditory Augmented Reality (AAR) realized with position-dynamic binaural synthesis over headphones. An established method to evaluate the plausibility of AAR asks participants to decide whether they are listening to the virtual or real version of the sound object. To date, this method has only been used to evaluate AAR systems for seated listeners. The AAR realization examined in this study instead allows listeners to turn to arbitrary directions and walk towards, past, and away from a real loudspeaker that reproduced sound only virtually. The experiment was conducted in two parts. In the first part, the subjects were asked whether they are listening to the real or the virtual version, not knowing that it was always the virtual version. In the second part, the real versions of the scenes where the loudspeaker actually reproduced sound were added. Two different source positions, three different test stimuli, and two different sound levels were considered. Seventeen volunteers, including five experts, participated. In the first part, none of the participants noticed that the virtual reproduction was active throughout the different test scenes. The inexperienced listeners tended to accept the virtual reproduction as real, while experts distributed their answers approximately equally. In the second part, experts could identify the virtual version quite reliably. For inexperienced listeners, the individual results varied enormously. Since the presence of the headphones influences the perception of the real sound field, this shadowing effect had to be considered in the creation of the virtual sound source as well. This requirement still limits test methods considering the real version in its ecological validity. Although the results indicate that the availability of a hidden real reference leads to a more critical evaluation, it is crucial to be aware that the presence of the headphones slightly distorts the reference. This issue seems more vital to the plausibility estimates achieved with this evaluation method than the increased freedom in motion.",

    "Filename": "Spatially Oriented Format for Acoustics 2.1 Introduction and Recent Advances.pdf",
    "Description": "Spatially oriented acoustic data can range from a simple set of impulse responses, such as head-related transfer functions, to a large set of multiple-input multiple-output spatial room impulse responses obtained in complex measurements with a microphone array excited by a loudspeaker array at various conditions. The spatially oriented format for acoustics (SOFA), which was standardized by AES Standard 69, provides a format to store and share such data. SOFA takes into account geometric representations of many acoustic scenarios, data compression, network transfer, and a link to complex room geometries and aims at simplifying the development of interfaces for many programming languages. With the recent advancement of SOFA, the format offers new continuous-direction representation of data by means of spherical harmonics and novel conventions representing many measurement scenarios, such as source directivity and multiple-input multiple-output spatial room impulse responses. This article reviews SOFA by first providing an introduction to SOFA and then describing examples that demonstrate the most recent features of the SOFA 2.1 (AES Standard 69-2022).",

    "Filename": "Binaural Ambisonics Its optimization and applications for auralization.pdf",
    "Description": "To better understand acoustic environment and the resulting auditory perception, it is essential to capture, analyze, and reproduce a sound field as a three-dimensional physical phenomenon because spatial aspects of auditory perception play important roles in various situations in our lives. Some approaches have been proposed to achieve the three-dimensional capture and reproduction of acoustic fields. Among them, Higher-Order Ambisonics (HOA) based on spherical harmonics expansion enables the capture and reproduction of a directivity pattern of incoming sound waves. On the basis of HOA, three-dimensional auditory space can be presented to a listener typically via a spherical loudspeaker array. In addition, binaural synthesis emulating the loudspeaker presentation enables HOA reproduction with a set of headphones or several loudspeakers by employing crosstalk cancellation. Thus, we are developing an HOA-based binaural reproduction/auralization system with head tracking. This system is aimed at realizing the reproduction and auralization of a sound field, including one excited by the listener's own voice. In this paper, we review the topics related to the reproduction and auralization of the sound field and introduce the HOA-based binaural synthesis system we have developed, as well as our works on sweet-spot expansion in HOA decoding and self-voice reproduction/auralization.",

    "Filename": "Solution Strategies for Linear Inverse Problems in Spatial Audio Signal Processing.pdf",
    "Description": "The aim of this study was to compare algorithms for solving inverse problems generally encountered in spatial audio signal processing. Tikhonov regularization is typically utilized to solve overdetermined linear systems in which the regularization parameter is selected by the golden section search (GSS) algorithm. For underdetermined problems with sparse solutions, several iterative compressive sampling (CS) methods are suggested as alternatives to traditional convex optimization (CVX) methods that are computationally expensive. The focal underdetermined system solver (FOCUSS), the steepest descent (SD) method, Newton\u2019s (NT) method, and the conjugate gradient (CG) method were developed to solve CS problems more efficiently in this study. These algorithms were compared in terms of problems, including source localization and separation, noise source identification, and analysis and synthesis of sound fields, by using a uniform linear array (ULA), a uniform circular array (UCA), and a random array. The derived results are discussed herein and guidelines for the application of these algorithms are summarized.",

    "Filename": "Acoustic contrast, planarity and robustness of sound zone methods using a circular loudspeaker array.pdf",
    "Description": "Since the mid 1990s, acoustics research has been undertaken relating to the sound zone problem\u2014using loudspeakers to deliver a region of high sound pressure while simultaneously creating an area where the sound is suppressed\u2014in order to facilitate independent listening within the same acoustic enclosure. The published solutions to the sound zone problem are derived from areas such as wave field synthesis and beamforming. However, the properties of such methods differ and performance tends to be compared against similar approaches. In this study, the suitability of energy focusing, energy cancelation, and synthesis approaches for sound zone reproduction is investigated. Anechoic simulations based on two zones surrounded by a circular array show each of the methods to have a characteristic performance, quantified in terms of acoustic contrast, array control effort and target sound field planarity. Regularization is shown to have a significant effect on the array effort and achieved acoustic contrast, particularly when mismatched conditions are considered between calculation of the source weights and their application to the system.",

==================================================

### **PRP Publication Timeline Visualization**


**Context:**
We want to give users immediate visual feedback on the search results in the Streamlit app *before* they download. We will add a "Publication Timeline" histogram.

**The Task:**

1. **Data Extraction:** Create a helper function that iterates through the list of found papers and extracts the `year` field. Handle `None` or missing years by categorizing them as "Unknown".
2. **Visualization:** Use Streamlit's native `st.bar_chart` or `st.altair_chart` to render a histogram.
* **X-Axis:** Year (sorted chronologically).
* **Y-Axis:** Count of papers.
* **Tooltip:** If using Altair, show the exact count on hover.


3. **UI Placement:** Insert this chart in the main `app.py` workflow immediately after the search completes but *before* the "Download ZIP" button appears.
* Add a subheader: `## Research Timeline`.



**Output:**
Return the Python code to generate the year-distribution dictionary and the Streamlit code to render the chart.

FILE: PRPs/# Fix 4.md
==================================================

### ** Fix 4 **

**Please rewrite `2_cluster_taxonomy.py` with this exact logic:**
1. **Input:**
* Use `argparse` to accept a required argument: `--topic` (e.g., "Spatial Audio").
* Load `research_catalog.csv`.


2. **The "Bouncer" (Gemini):**
* Update the prompt: *'The user is researching "{topic}". Review these abstracts. If a paper is NOT primarily about {topic}, assign the category "DISCARD". For valid papers, group them into 4-6 technical categories.'*


3. **The Filter:**
* Drop rows where Category is 'DISCARD'.
* Print 'Rejected X off-topic papers.'


4. **The Structure:**
* **Root:** Set the base directory to `./Library/{topic_sanitized}/`.
* Create sub-folders there.


5. **The Output:**
* Add a column `Topic` to the DataFrame and set it to the provided argument.
* Save to `research_catalog_categorized.csv`."

==================================================


### **PRP: Filename Customization (The Renamer)**

**Context:**
Users currently receive PDFs with default filenames that are often hard to read. We need to allow users to customize the naming convention of downloaded PDFs via the Streamlit interface.

**The Task:**

1. **Update UI:** Add a selectbox in the Streamlit Sidebar under "Settings" labeled "PDF Filename Format".
* **Options:**
* `Title` (Default)
* `Author - Year - Title`
* `Year - Journal - Title`




2. **Update Logic:** Refactor the `save_pdf()` or `download_paper()` function to respect this setting.
3. **Sanitization (Critical):**
* You must implement a strict string sanitizer. Paper titles often contain illegal characters for file systems (`:`, `/`, `\`, `?`, `*`, `"`, `<`, `>`, `|`).
* Replace these characters with an underscore `_` or a dash `-`.
* Truncate filenames to 255 characters max to prevent OS errors.


4. **Metadata Sync:** Ensure that whatever filename is chosen is updated in the `index.json` and the `Catalog_Summary.md` so the links still work.

**Output:**
Return the updated Streamlit UI code snippet and the refactored PDF saving logic containing the sanitization function.

FILE: PRPs/# adding Google Drive.md
==================================================


> **Context:**
>  I want to add a feature to save research papers directly to the user's Google Drive so they can be easily imported into NotebookLM later.
> **Task:**
> Create a new "Save to Drive" feature in the UI and implement the necessary backend logic using the Google Drive API.
> **1. UI Requirements:**
> * **Button Location:** Place a new button immediately to the right of the existing "Download Full Library (ZIP)" button.
> * **Button Style:** Use a secondary style (outline or distinct color) to differentiate it from the direct download. Use a "Google Drive" icon or a "Cloud Upload" icon.
> * **Label:** The button text should read "Save to Drive".
> * **Feedback:** When clicked, show a "Saving..." loading state on the button. On success, show a toast notification: "Saved to 'Research Assistant' folder in Drive."
> 
> 
> **2. Authentication & Scopes (Critical):**
> * Update the existing Firebase Google Auth provider configuration.
> * We need to request an additional scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file`.
> * *Note:* This scope is "non-sensitive" relative to full Drive access because it only allows the app to access/edit files created *by the app itself*, which is perfect for this use case.
> 
> 
> **3. Logic Flow:**
> * **Check Auth:** When the button is clicked, check if the current user has granted the Drive scope. If not, trigger a re-authentication flow to ask for permission.
> * **Folder Management:** Check if a folder named `_Research_Assistant_Imports` exists in the root of their Drive. If not, create it.
> * **Upload Process:**
> * Take the list of papers (PDFs) that are currently staged for the ZIP download.
> * Loop through them and upload each PDF to the `_Research_Assistant_Imports` folder.
> * Ensure the MIME type is set to `application/pdf` so NotebookLM recognizes them correctly.
> 
> 
> **4. Implementation Details:**
> * Use the Google Drive API v3.
> * Reuse the existing data fetching logic used for the ZIP creator; do not fetch the papers a second time if they are already in memory.

==================================================

### PRP: The "Direct Expansion" Refactor

**Role:** Senior Search Architect
**Task:** Delete the `search_via_citation_backdoor` complexity. Replace it with a **High-Fidelity Topic Expansion Search**.

#### 1. Phase 1: High-Quality Topic Expansion (LLM)

* **Goal:** Generate 15-20 specific sub-fields for the User's Topic.
* **Prompt Logic:** "The user is researching **{topic}**. Provide 20 academic synonyms, sub-disciplines, or related technical fields. (e.g., for 'Spatial Audio', include 'Binaural', 'Ambisonics', 'Wave Field Synthesis', 'HRTF', '3D Audio'). Return a clean list."

#### 2. Phase 2: The Direct "AND" Query

* **Logic:** Construct the OpenAlex query to require the **Primary Keyword** AND at least **One Topic Synonym**.
* **Query String:** `("crosstalk cancellation") AND ("Spatial Audio" OR "Binaural" OR "Ambisonics" OR "Wave Field Synthesis" ...)`
* **Why this wins:** This is the specific logic that catches the Choueiri paper (which is about "Crosstalk" in the context of "3D Audio") while killing the DSL papers (which are "Crosstalk" in the context of "Subscriber Lines").

#### 3. Phase 3: The Section-Aware PDF Gate

* **Action:** We still download the PDF and check the **First 2 Pages** for the fuzzy regex of the keyword.
* **Why:** OpenAlex abstracts are still untrustworthy. The API gets us to the right *file*, but the **PDF Auditor** confirms the *content*.

FILE: PRPs/# 9_5 backdoor citations exapnsion.md
==================================================


# Product Requirements Prompt: Implement Citation Backward-Chaining Search

**Role:** Senior Python Engineer / Search Architect
**Task:** Refactor the provided `ResearchCrawler` script to replace the current "Hybrid RAG/Topic" search logic with a new "Citation Backward-Chaining" (Backdoor) discovery algorithm.

## Context

The current script uses a `HybridTreeSearch` (RAG) approach to map user queries to OpenAlex topics. This approach fails for niche or drifting terminology (e.g., "Crosstalk Cancellation" vs "Personal Sound Zones"). We need to replace this with a heuristic approach that finds the "Godfathers" of a field via citation analysis and uses their recent vocabulary to engineer the final search query.

## Core Requirement: The "Backdoor" Algorithm

You must delete the `search_openalex_multi_pass` method and the `HybridTreeSearch` imports. Replace them with a new workflow, `search_via_citation_backdoor`, which implements the following logic:

### Phase 1: The "Junk" Harvest (Find the Ghost)

1. **Search:** Perform a lightweight API call to OpenAlex `works` using the user's raw `topic` and `keywords`.
* *Constraint:* Do not filter for PDFs or Open Access yet. We just need metadata.
* *Params:* `per-page=50`, `select=referenced_works`.


2. **Analyze:** Iterate through these 50 results. Collect every ID found in their `referenced_works` list.
3. **Identify:** Use a `Counter` to find the single most frequently cited paper ID (The "Ghost" paper).

### Phase 2: The Pivot (Find the VIP)

1. **Fetch:** Retrieve the metadata for that "Ghost" paper ID.
2. **Extract:** Identify the primary author (The "VIP") from that paper.

### Phase 3: Terminology Expansion (Learn the Vocabulary)

1. **Query:** Search OpenAlex for works by this VIP Author ID, filtered to `publication_year > 2020` (Recent works).
2. **Extract:** Analyze the **titles** of these recent works. Extract the most frequent 2-word and 3-word phrases (N-grams) that are *not* the original seed keywords.
3. **Output:** A list of "Modern Synonyms" (e.g., discovering "BRIR" from "Crosstalk").

### Phase 4: The Final Dragnet

1. **Construct:** Create a new Boolean OR query string: `(Original Keywords) OR (New Modern Synonyms)`.
2. **Execute:** Pass this new engineered query into the existing `execute_openalex_query` method to perform the actual PDF downloading and strict filtering using the existing infrastructure.

## Technical Specifications & Changes

1. **Remove Dependencies:**
* Remove `from hybrid_search_client import HybridTreeSearch`.
* Remove any code related to `openalex_tree.json` or `chroma_db`.


2. **New Method Implementation:**
* Implement `search_via_citation_backdoor(self)` inside the `ResearchCrawler` class.
* Ensure strict error handling: If Phase 1 yields no results (no citations found), fall back gracefully to a standard text search using the original keywords.


3. **Refine `run` Loop:**
* Update the `run()` method to call `self.search_via_citation_backdoor()` instead of `self.search_openalex_multi_pass()`.


4. **Preserve Existing filters:**
* Do **not** modify `_check_accessibility`, `_pre_filter`, or `_process_batch`. We still need to strictly validate the final PDFs.
* Ensure the "Final Dragnet" (Phase 4) still respects the user's `date_start`, `date_end`, and `is_oa:true` requirements.



## Expected Behavior

If I search for "Crosstalk Cancellation":

1. The script finds 50 mediocre papers.
2. It notices they all cite Edgar Choueiri's 2008 paper.
3. It pivots to Choueiri's profile.
4. It sees his 2024 paper titled "...Binaural Room Impulse Response...".
5. It adds "Binaural Room Impulse Response" to the search.
6. It downloads the Choueiri 2024 paper (which the previous script missed).

FILE: PRPs/# Fix 5.md
==================================================

### **The Code Update**

I need to update Phase 3 and 4 to support a persistent library where multiple topics can coexist.
**Please rewrite `2_cluster_taxonomy.py`:**
1. **Arguments:** Keep the `--topic` argument.
2. **Paths:** Set the root for this batch to `./Library/{args.topic}/`. Use `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` to allow adding to existing topics.
3. **The 'Golden Path':** Add a column `Directory_Path` to the CSV containing the full relative path for each paper's category.
4. **The Bouncer:** Keep the 'DISCARD' logic to filter irrelevant papers.


**Please rewrite `3_download_library.py`:**
1. **Targeted Logic:** Read `Directory_Path` from the CSV to know exactly where to save each file.
2. **Surgical Cleanup:**
* After downloading, iterate **only** through the unique paths listed in the `Directory_Path` column of the current CSV.
* If one of *those* folders has no PDF files, delete it.
* **Crucial:** Do NOT iterate through the entire `./Library` root. Do not touch other topic folders.


3. **Focused Export:**
* Create a zip file named `Library_{Topic}.zip` (e.g., `Library_Spatial_Audio.zip`) that contains only the folder for the current topic.


4. **Catalog:**
* Generate a markdown catalog named `Catalog_{Topic}.md` inside the topic folder.
* Use `YYYY/MM/DD` date format.

# PRP: Polish Taxonomy Logic (Stopword Cleanup)

**Context:**
We have successfully refactored `src/2_cluster_taxonomy.py` to use structured JSON output. However, test logs indicate that category names are occasionally being truncated awkwardly (e.g., ending in "and") due to a strict word-count slice.

**Objective:**
Refine the category name cleaning logic to handle trailing stopwords gracefully while maintaining brevity.

**Target File:** `src/2_cluster_taxonomy.py`

## 🛠️ Engineering Requirements

### 1. New Dependency

* Ensure `re` (regex) is imported at the top of the file (it likely already is, but verify).

### 2. Update Cleaning Logic

In the `cluster_and_categorize` function, inside the loop where `local_map` is populated:

**Locate this current logic:**

```python
# Enforce the "Max 3 Words" rule in code just in case
cat_clean = " ".join(item['category_name'].split()[:4])

```

**Replace it with this Robust Logic:**

```python
# 1. Take the full name from the LLM (trust the schema constraint first)
cat_raw = item['category_name'].strip()

# 2. Safety Truncate: Only chop if it's excessively long (> 6 words), not 4.
# This prevents cutting off meaningful modifiers like "Measurements".
words = cat_raw.split()
if len(words) > 6:
    cat_raw = " ".join(words[:6])

# 3. Stopword Cleanup: Remove trailing connectors that might have been exposed by truncation
# Regex targets: and, or, of, the, for, in, on, with, to
cat_clean = re.sub(r'\s+(and|or|of|the|for|in|on|with|to)$', '', cat_raw, flags=re.IGNORECASE).strip()

local_map[item['id']] = cat_clean

```

### 3. Verification

* Ensure the variable `cat_clean` is the one assigned to `local_map[item['id']]`.
* Ensure no syntax errors are introduced by the regex string.

## ✅ Definition of Done

1. **Logic Update:** The crude `[:4]` slice is replaced by a smarter length check (`>6`).
2. **Stopword Safety:** A category like "Crosstalk Cancellation Implementation and" is automatically cleaned to "Crosstalk Cancellation Implementation".
3. **Stability:** The script runs without regex compilation errors.

==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# Full Security Setup.md
==================================================

### The "Full Security" Setup (`.env`)

 I need to set up the `.env` file correctly for both the search tools and the AI agents.
 1. **Create `.gitignore`:** Ensure `.env` is listed here so I never accidentally publish my keys.
 2. **Create `.env`:** Create this file in the root with the following variables:
 ```bash
 # The Brain (Required for Phase 3)
 GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
 
 ``` 

 ```
 # The Search Tools (Required for Phase 2)
 UNPAYWALL_EMAIL=your_email@gmail.com
 
 ```
 
 

 ```
 # Optional Keys (Leave empty if not using yet)
 SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_KEY=
 CORE_API_KEY=
 ```
 
 ```
 
 
 3. **Update the Script:** Update `1_search_omni.py` to load these variables using `dotenv`. It should use `UNPAYWALL_EMAIL` for the 'Unlocker' step.
 4. **Instructions:** Tell me exactly where to paste my Google API Key once the file is created.
 
 




==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# Phase 2.md
==================================================

### Phase 2:

Write the modular search script named `1_search_omni.py`.
**1. Data Structure (Crucial):**
The script must initialize a pandas DataFrame with **exactly** these columns. Ensure every row adheres to this schema:

* `Title`: (String) Cleaned title.
* `Original_Filename`: (String) Attempt to parse this from the URL (e.g., '1706.03762.pdf'). If not obvious in the URL, set to 'Pending_Header_Check'. **Do NOT invent a filename.**
* `Publication_Date`: (String) Format strictly as **YYYY/MM/DD**. (If source only gives year, default to YYYY/01/01).
* `Category`: (String) Initialize as 'Unsorted'.
* `Description`: (String) Abstract or Summary.
* `Is_Paywalled`: (Boolean) True if no direct PDF link found; False if direct link exists.
* `Is_Downloaded`: (Boolean) Initialize as **False** for all.
* `Source_URL`: (String) Direct PDF link or landing page.
* `DOI`: (String) Digital Object Identifier.

**2. Architecture:**
Create a class `ResearchCrawler` with a method for each source. It should accept `--query`, `--year_start`, and `--count`.
**3. Source Modules (Implement logic for ALL of these):**

* **1. Google Scholar:** Use `scholarly`. **Crucial:** Add a 10-second sleep between requests to avoid IP bans. If it fails, log error and skip.
* **2. Semantic Scholar:** Use the API. Search broadly.
* **3. BASE (Bielefeld):** Use `sickle` to query the BASE OAI-PMH endpoint.
* **4. CORE:** Use the CORE API (requires generic API key logic) or search their open dataset.
* **5. Preprint Servers:**
* **arXiv:** Query specifically in `eess.AS`, `cs.SD`, and `physics.gen-ph`.
* **OSF Preprints:** Use `requests` to hit the OSF API v2 (filter by 'preprint').
* **Zenodo:** Search the Zenodo API (keywords + year).
* **6. Open Access Journals:**
* **DOAJ:** Query the DOAJ public API.
* **PLOS:** Query the PLOS Search API.
* **7. Conference Archives (Scrapers):**
* **DAFx:** Write a `BeautifulSoup` scraper to parse the DAFx archive page for titles matching the query.
* **ISMIR:** Scrape the ISMIR proceedings list.
* **8. The "Unlocker" (For AES/IEEE/Paywalled):**
* For any result found above that lacks a direct PDF link, take its DOI.
* Run the DOI through `pyunpaywall` AND `Open Access Button` API.
* If a free version is found, update `Source_URL` and set `Is_Paywalled` to False.

**4. Output:**

* Combine all results into one Pandas DataFrame.
* **Deduplicate:** Aggressively remove duplicates based on normalized Title/DOI.
* Save to `research_catalog.csv`.
* Print a summary: 'Found [X] papers total: [A] from ArXiv, [B] from Scholar, [C] from BASE...'

==================================================

### **Feature Implementation: Local Alert System (Real Email Test)**

**Context:**
We are building the "Scholar-Alert" scheduler. We need a fully functional **local test rig** that checks for new papers and sends **REAL notification emails** to the user using Gmail SMTP.

**1. Database Schema (SQLite)**
Create/Update `alerts.db` using `sqlite3`. Ensure the `subscriptions` table exists:

* `id` (Primary Key)
* `user_email` (String) - *Target email address*
* `search_query` (String)
* `search_source` (String)
* `last_run` (Datetime)
* `active` (Boolean)

**2. Streamlit UI Updates (`app.py`)**
Add a "Manage Alerts" section to the Sidebar.

* **Input:** "Save current search as Alert."
* **Logic:** Insert the current search and the user's email into `alerts.db`.
* **Visual:** Show a list of active alerts.

**3. The Scheduler Script (`scheduler_test.py`)**
Create a script that performs the check and sends the email.

**A. The Search Logic**

* Connect to `alerts.db`.
* For every active subscription, run `search_papers()`.
* **Filter:** Keep only papers where `publication_date` > `last_run`.

**B. The Email Logic (Real SMTP)**

* **Library:** Use `smtplib` and `email.message`.
* **Credentials:** distinct variables `SENDER_EMAIL` and `SENDER_APP_PASSWORD` (load these from a `.env` file or constants at the top).
* **Function:** `send_notification_email(to_email, query, papers_list)`
* **Server:** `smtp.gmail.com`
* **Port:** `587` (TLS)
* **Logic:**
1. Login to SMTP server.
2. Construct a proper HTML email.
3. Subject: "New Research Found: [Query Name]"
4. Body: A clean list of the new papers found (Title + Link).
5. Send the email.




* **Error Handling:** Wrap the send logic in a `try/except` block. If the password is wrong or connection fails, print the specific error to the console so we can debug.

**4. The "Time Travel" Helper**
Include a function `reset_dates_for_testing()` in the script that forces all `last_run` dates in the database to **30 days ago**. This allows us to run the script immediately and trigger a "New Paper" condition to verify the email actually sends.

---

### **Crucial Setup Step for You (Before running the code)**

To make this work, you cannot use your normal Gmail login password (Google blocks scripts from doing that). You need an **App Password**:

1. Go to your **Google Account Settings** > **Security**.
2. Enable **2-Step Verification** (if not already on).
3. Search for **"App Passwords"** in the search bar.
4. Create a new one named "ScholarStack Test".
5. Google will give you a 16-character code (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`). **This is the password** you will put in your script (or `.env` file).

Run the prompt, get the code, insert that App Password, and the email will arrive in your inbox for real.

### PRP: The "Precision Dredge" Refactor

**Role:** Senior AI/Search Engineer

**Task:** Refactor the synonym generation and PDF auditing logic to eliminate semantic drift and PDF parsing errors.

#### 1. Context-Locked Vocabulary (Level 2 Fix)

* **Prompt Update:** "Extract 15 technical synonyms from these titles. RULE: Every synonym MUST be relevant to [Spatial Audio]. If a title is about 'Seawater' or 'Anodes', ignore it. PHRASES MUST BE 3-4 WORDS LONG (e.g., 'Multi-channel inverse filtering' instead of 'Inverse methods')."

#### 2. The "Dragnet" Constraint

* **Logic:** Re-introduce a "Soft Anchor." The final search should be: `(Original Keyword OR Technical Synonyms) AND (Topic OR Topic Synonyms)`.
* *Why:* Since our synonyms are currently too weak ("Active Control"), we need the topic anchor to stop the "Zinc Anode" papers from entering the pool in the first place.

#### 3. Robust PDF Text Extraction

* **Requirement:** Change the PyMuPDF extraction call to:
`page.get_text("text", flags=fitz.TEXT_PRESERVE_WHITESPACE | fitz.TEXT_DEHYPHENATE | fitz.TEXT_MEDIABOX_CLIP)`
* **Stability:** Wrap the extraction in a `try/except` that catches `RuntimeError` specifically for MuPDF syntax errors, allowing the script to skip the graphics and just read the text layer.

# Fast vs. Deep Mode: Implementation Proposal

## 1. Metrics Comparison (1,000 Papers)

| Feature | **Fast Mode** (The Skim) | **Deep Mode** (The Scholar) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Est. Duration** | **~15 Minutes** | **~90 - 120 Minutes** |
| **Success Rate** | ~60-70% (Direct Only) | ~90-95% (Deep Web Hunt) |
| **Organization** | Flat Folder (Unsorted) | AI Categorized Folders |
| **Storage (Temp)** | Low | High |

---

## 2. Process Changes

### A. Phase 1: Search (No Change)
Both modes still fetch metadata from OpenAlex/ArXiv. (~5 mins)

### B. Phase 2: AI Clustering
*   **Deep**: Uses LLM provided taxonomy to sort papers into semantic folders. (~15 mins)
*   **Fast**: **CUT**. All papers go into a single "Unsorted" folder (or Year/Journal structure from metadata). Saves 15 mins.

### C. Phase 3: Downloading
*   **Deep**: Tries Direct -> Unpaywall -> Semantic Scholar -> DuckDuckGo -> Google -> Landing Page Scraping.
*   **Fast**: **CUT** all "Search" steps.
    *   Only attempts:
        1.  `Source URL` (Direct link from API)
        2.  `Unpaywall` (DOI lookup)
    *   If these fail, the paper is skipped immediately.

---

## 3. UI Implementation
Add a Radio Button to the Sidebar:

**Research Intensity:**
*   ( ) **⚡ Fast (Direct Downloads Only)**
    *   *Best for: Quick checks, gathering easy PDFs, saving time.*
*   (•) **🧠 Deep (AI Sort + Web Scrape)**
    *   *Best for: Comprehensive libraries, finding obscure papers, organized research.*

---

## 4. Why 15 Minutes?
*   **1000 Papers**:
    *   ~600 will have direct links. @ 2s/paper (4 threads) = **5 mins**.
    *   ~400 will fail instantly. @ 0.1s/paper = **<1 min**.
    *   Search/Overhead = **5 mins**.
    *   **Total**: ~11-15 Minutes.

## Decision
Does this meet your requirements? If yes, I will proceed to implement the UI toggle and backend logic.

### Instructions for the Agent

1. **Place the File:** Save the code above as `test_crawler_logic.py` in the same folder as `research_crawler.py`.
2. **Run the Tests:** Execute `python test_crawler_logic.py` in the terminal.
3. **Interpret Results:**
* **Phase 1 & 3 Tests:** These should pass instantly. If they fail, there is a logic error in your N-gram extraction or counting loops.
* **Live Test:** This is the most important output.
* If it prints `✅ SUCCESS`, the "Backdoor" strategy is confirmed valid for the current state of the database.
* If it prints `⚠️ WARNING`, the agent should check if "Crosstalk" has drifted so far that even the citations aren't linking back to Choueiri (unlikely, but possible).





==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# 10_1 still working on taxonomy.md
==================================================

### 1. The Strategy: "Forced Adoption"

Currently, if a paper generates a unique category (e.g., "Ambisonic Decoding") but it's the *only* paper in that category, the system marks it as an "orphan" and throws it into Miscellaneous.

**The Fix:** instead of throwing orphans into the trash (Miscellaneous), we will merge them into the **closest existing valid category**.

### 2. The PRP (Product Requirements Prompt)

Copy and paste this PRP into your agent workspace to fix the `src/2_cluster_taxonomy.py` logic.

---

# PRP: Fix "Miscellaneous" Dumping (Orphan Adoption Logic)

**Context:**
The current taxonomy engine is overly aggressive with its "Density Check." If a category has fewer than 2 papers, those papers are currently reassigned to "Miscellaneous." This results in a massive "Miscellaneous" folder containing perfectly good papers that just happened to be in small groups.

**Objective:**
Modify the Orphan Logic. Instead of dumping small groups into "Miscellaneous," we should:

1. **Keep** small categories if they are highly specific (Size = 1 is okay if the name is technical).
2. **Force-Assign** orphans to the "Next Best" category if possible, rather than "Miscellaneous."

**Target File:** `src/2_cluster_taxonomy.py`

## 🛠️ Engineering Requirements

### 1. Relax Density Thresholds

In `cluster_and_categorize`, locate the section labeled **"Enforce Orphan Rules"** (or similar density check logic).

**Change the Logic to:**

* **Threshold:** Reduce the minimum density from `2` to `1`.
* **Rule:** If a category has at least 1 paper, **KEEP IT**.
* **Reasoning:** It is better to have a folder named "Ambisonic Decoding" with 1 paper than a folder named "Miscellaneous" with 20 unrelated papers.

### 2. The "General" Fallback (The Safety Net)

* **Logic:** Only use "Miscellaneous" if the LLM explicitly returned "General" or failed to output JSON.
* **Implementation:** Remove the code block that iterates through `orphans` and reassigns them to `general_cat`.

### 3. Implementation Plan (Code Replacement)

**Find this block (or similar):**

```python
# Old Logic (DELETE THIS)
counts = Counter(taxonomy_map.values())
orphans = [cat for cat, count in counts.items() if count < 2]
if orphans:
    for doc_id, cat in taxonomy_map.items():
        if cat in orphans:
            taxonomy_map[doc_id] = "Miscellaneous"

```

**Replace with this (KEEP EVERYTHING):**

```python
# New Logic: No Orphan Reassignment
# We accept singleton categories to prevent "Miscellaneous" bloating.
counts = Counter(taxonomy_map.values())
print(f"DEBUG: Category Distribution: {counts}") 
# (No re-assignment code here)

```

## ✅ Definition of Done

1. **Zero False Miscellaneous:** A paper is only in "Miscellaneous" if the LLM truly could not categorize it.
2. **Singleton Folders Allowed:** You will likely see folders with 1 PDF. This is acceptable and preferred over the current behavior.



==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# Phase 3.md
==================================================

### ** Phase 3 **


"Phase 2 is a success! I have a `research_catalog.csv` with 17 papers. Now, let's build **Phase 3: The Smart Architect**.
1. **Create `2_cluster_taxonomy.py**`:
* This script must load `research_catalog.csv`.
* It must use the **Gemini 1.5 Flash** model (via `google-generativeai`) using the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` from our `.env` file.


2. **The AI Logic**:
* Send the list of Titles and Descriptions (Abstracts) to Gemini.
* Ask Gemini to: *'Analyze these papers and create 4-6 logical technical categories (Taxonomy) for a library. Return a JSON mapping of each Paper Title to a Category.'*


3. **The Organization (In Workspace)**:
* Update the `Category` column in the DataFrame based on Gemini's response.
* **Create a root directory named `./Library**` in the current workspace.
* Inside that, create sub-folders for each category (e.g., `./Library/Spatial_Audio_Reconstruction/`).
* Save the updated CSV as `research_catalog_categorized.csv`.


4. **Safety**: Ensure it handles API errors gracefully and uses a wait timer if the abstract list is long."

### PRP: Domain-Weighted Semantic Expansion

**Role:** Senior AI/Search Architect

**Task:** Refactor the synonym generation to prioritize technical specificity over word count, ensuring the "Backdoor" finds specialized papers like Choueiri's.

#### 1. Title Pre-Filtering (The Junk Wall)

* **Action:** Locally filter the Expert Panel's 150+ titles.
* **Rule:** A title only goes to the LLM if it contains at least one domain word: `[audio, sound, acoustic, loudspeaker, binaural, signal, hrtf, ear, hear, microphone, loudspeaker]`.
* **Goal:** This prevents the "Seawater/Concrete" hallucination by making the non-audio work of the experts invisible to the LLM.

#### 2. Intelligence-Led Extraction (The LLM)

* **Instruction:** "Identify the 15 most specific technical synonyms, acronyms, or methods for '{keyword}'.
* **Rule:** Accept single-word terms if they are domain-specific (e.g., 'Transaural'). If a term is broad (e.g., 'Active Control'), expand it to be specific (e.g., 'Active Sound Control').
* **Constraint:** NO generic filler ('dataset', 'study', 'system'). NO full paper titles."

#### 3. The Dragnet & The Gate

* **Retrieval:** Search `(Original_Keyword OR Technical_Synonyms)`.
* **The Audit:** Use the **Robust PDF Front-Matter Auditor** to verify the presence of the original fuzzy regex (`cross[\s\-]*talk[\s\-]*cancellations?`) in the actual text of the first 2 pages.

---


==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# Fix.md
==================================================

### **The Fix: Smart Cleanup & Readable Catalog**

I need to refine `3_download_library.py` to fix two issues:
1. **Ghost Folder Cleanup (Critical):**
* The script currently zips *all* folders, even empty ones.
* **New Logic:** After the download loop finishes, iterate through `./Library`.
* If a category folder is empty (contains no files), **delete it** from the file system.
* *Then* create the `Library_Export.zip`. This ensures the zip only contains folders with actual papers.


2. **Human-Readable CSV:**
* The current CSV is hard to read.
* **New Logic:** When saving `final_library_catalog.csv`, reorder the columns to put the most important info first:
* `Category`, `Title`, `Publication_Date`, `Original_Filename`, `Source_URL`


* **Sort** the rows by `Category` so related papers are grouped together.
* (Optional) If possible, use a tab-separator (`sep='\t'`) or just standard comma, but ensure newlines in the Description don't break the format.

# PRP: Refined Semantic Discovery Logic

**Role:** Senior AI Prompt Engineer
**Task:** Refactor the `get_technical_synonyms_from_llm` method to prevent title-copying and maximize technical "bait" variety.

## 1. Multi-Stage Topic Expansion (Level 1+)

The user wants **more** of these.

* **Requirement:** Increase the topic expansion from 5 to **10-12 terms**.
* **Instruction:** Tell the LLM to include "Signal Processing" and "Acoustic Engineering" sub-disciplines to ensure we catch Choueiri's more mathematical papers.

## 2. Technical Phrase Extraction (Level 2 Fix)

Refactor the prompt for the Expert Vocabulary phase:

* **Constraint 1:** "Do NOT return full paper titles."
* **Constraint 2:** "Return only technical phrases between 2 and 4 words long."
* **Constraint 3:** "Focus on the **Mathematical Methods** and **Hardware Configurations** mentioned (e.g., 'Recursive Filters', 'Stereo Dipole', 'Transaural Synthesis')."
* **Constraint 4:** "Include common abbreviations (e.g., 'CTC', 'XTC', 'BRIR', 'HRTF')."

## 3. The "Broad Net" Final Search

* **Query Construction:** Use the ~10 Topic terms and the ~10 Method terms.
* **Logic:** `(Keyword OR Method1 OR Method2...) AND (Topic1 OR Topic2 OR Topic3...)`

---

### Corrected Implementation Block for the Agent

Give this code to the agent to fix the "Regurgitation" bug:

```python
def get_technical_synonyms_from_llm(self, titles, seed_keyword):
    prompt = (
        f"Goal: Identify 10 high-leverage search terms for the topic '{seed_keyword}'.\n"
        f"Context: Here are 150 titles from top experts in this field:\n"
        f"{' | '.join(titles[:150])}\n\n"
        f"TASKS:\n"
        f"1. Identify the CORE MATHEMATICAL METHODS or FILTER TYPES used.\n"
        f"2. Identify the HARDWARE SETUP terms (e.g., 'loudspeaker array', 'dipole').\n"
        f"3. Identify common ACRONYMS (e.g., CTC, XTC).\n"
        f"\nRULES:\n"
        f"- NO FULL TITLES.\n"
        f"- PHRASES MUST BE 2-4 WORDS MAX.\n"
        f"- RETURN ONLY A COMMA-SEPARATED LIST."
    )
    # Get response and clean it
    raw_response = self.llm_query(prompt)
    synonyms = [s.strip().lower() for s in raw_response.split(',') if len(s.strip().split()) > 1]
    return synonyms[:12] # Return more terms as requested

```

FILE: PRPs/# 9_9_6.md
==================================================

### PRP: The "Variable-Constraint" Backdoor

**Role:** Senior Generalist Search Engineer
**Task:** Refactor the Synonym Generation to use the User's Topic as a dynamic filter, eliminating "polysemic drift" (like "Active Control") without hardcoding domain terms.

#### 1. The Dynamic Anchor Prompt

Instead of injecting "Audio" words, inject the `self.raw_topic` variable into the prompt instructions.

* **Prompt Logic:**
"The user is researching **{topic}**. The primary keyword is **{keyword}**.
Below is a list of recent titles from a top expert in this field.
**Constraint:** This expert may work in multiple disciplines. You must **IGNORE** any titles or terms that are not strictly relevant to **{topic}**.
**Task:** Extract 15 technical synonyms, methods, or acronyms for **{keyword}** that appear in the relevant titles.
**Output:** Comma-separated list."

#### 2. Why this works for ANY field:

* **Case A (Current):** Input is "Spatial Audio". LLM sees "Seawater Concrete" title. LLM checks: "Is Seawater relevant to Spatial Audio?" -> No. Discards it.
* **Case B (Future):** Input is "Gene Editing". Expert also writes about "Patent Law". LLM checks: "Is Patent Law relevant to Gene Editing mechanisms?" -> No. Discards it. Keeps "Cas9".

#### 3. Execution (The Dragnet & Gate)

* **Dragnet:** `(Original Keyword OR Anchored_Synonyms)`.
* *Result:* "Active Control" is filtered out or qualified (e.g., "Active Noise Control") by the LLM because "Active Control" alone is too broad for the "Spatial Audio" topic constraint.


* **Gate:** The **PDF Front-Matter Audit** (Section-Aware) remains the final truth, checking for the original keyword.

---

### Implementation Block (General Purpose)

Here is the Python method that uses the variables correctly to sanitize the synonyms without hardcoding.

```python
def get_technical_synonyms_from_llm(self, titles, seed_keyword, user_topic):
    """
    Extracts synonyms using the User's Topic as the semantic guardrail.
    Works for any domain (Audio, Biology, Physics, etc.).
    """
    prompt = (
        f"CONTEXT: The user is researching '{user_topic}'. "
        f"The primary keyword is '{seed_keyword}'.\n"
        f"SOURCE DATA: Here are recent paper titles from a identified expert in this field:\n"
        f"{' | '.join(titles[:150])}\n\n"
        f"TASK: Identify 15 specific technical synonyms, acronyms, or method names for '{seed_keyword}' "
        f"that are used within the domain of '{user_topic}'.\n\n"
        f"RULES:\n"
        f"1. FILTER IRRELEVANCE: The expert may publish in other fields. IGNORE titles unrelated to '{user_topic}'.\n"
        f"2. PRECISION: If a term is broad (like 'Active Control'), qualify it to fit '{user_topic}' (e.g., 'Active Noise Control').\n"
        f"3. FORMAT: Return ONLY a comma-separated list of phrases (2-4 words). No full titles."

==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# 10 Add standardized metadata.md
==================================================


### **Refactor Task: Metadata Standardization & Multi-Format Export**

**Context:**
The "Librarian" app currently downloads papers and generates a `catalog.md` file. We are upgrading the metadata engine.
**Constraint:** Do NOT change the downloading or folder organization logic. Only refactor the **metadata dictionary** and the **export file generation**.

**The Goal:**
We need to standardize our internal metadata format and then output that data into **three** specific files for the user:

1. `catalog.md` (Existing feature - must be preserved and updated)
2. `catalog.csv` (New feature - for data analysis)
3. `citations.ris` (New feature - for Zotero/EndNote)

---

### **Step 1: Standardize the Internal Metadata Dictionary**

Ensure your paper objects/dictionaries now strictly use these keys. If data is missing from the API, default to `None` or `""`.

* **Keys:** `title`, `authors` (list of strings), `year` (YYYY), `date` (YYYY-MM-DD), `journal` (or venue), `doi`, `url` (source link), `pdf_url` (direct link), `abstract`, `citation_count`, `filename` (local filename).

---

### **Step 2: Update the Existing Markdown Generator (`catalog.md`)**

You are already generating this file. Update the function to add the new standard keys above. Keep existing keys not covered by the new ones (such as "status"). Make sure the .md version retiains the "Search Settings" section.

* **Format:** Keep the existing table format for readability.
* **Columns:** `| Title | First Author | Year | Journal | Citations | Link |`
* **Rule:** For the "Link" column, use the `url` field formatted as a Markdown link `[Source](url)`.
* **Rule:** For "First Author", only take the first item from the `authors` list and append "et al." if the list length is > 1.
* **Note:** Do not put the `abstract` in the table.

---

### **Step 3: Implement New Export Formats**

#### **A. Generate `catalog.csv**`

Create a function to dump the full metadata into a CSV.

* **Columns:** `Title`, `Authors` (join list with semicolon), `Year`, `Journal`, `DOI`, `Citation_Count`, `URL`, `PDF_Link`, `Filename`, `Abstract`.
* **Critical:** Use a CSV library to strictly handle escaping. The `Abstract` and `Title` fields often contain commas and newlines that will break the file if not quoted correctly.

#### **B. Generate `citations.ris**`

Create a function to generate an RIS file for reference managers.

* **Strict Formatting:**
* Start record: `TY  - JOUR` (Two spaces after TY, one after hyphen)
* End record: `ER  - `


* **Tag Mapping:**
* `TI`: `title`
* `AU`: `authors` (Loop through list: create a separate `AU  - Name` line for **every** author).
* `PY`: `year`
* `JO`: `journal`
* `DO`: `doi`
* `UR`: `url`
* `L1`: `pdf_url` (**Important:** This maps the direct PDF link).
* `AB`: `abstract`



**Output:**
Return the code that takes the list of paper objects and generates the strings for `catalog.md`, `catalog.csv`, and `citations.ris`.

# PRP: Implement "Intellectual Velocity" UI Theme

**Role:** Expert Streamlit Frontend Developer
**Objective:** Overhaul the visual identity of **ScholarStack** to match the new "Intellectual Velocity" brand guidelines. This involves updating the Streamlit configuration, injecting custom CSS for advanced styling, and integrating the new logo asset.

## 1. Asset Preparation

* **Action:** Create a directory named `src/assets/` if it does not exist.
* **Action:** Expect a logo file (e.g., `logo.png`) to be placed in this folder.
* **Requirement:** Ensure the application can reference images relative to the `src` directory.

## 2. Streamlit Configuration (`.streamlit/config.toml`)

**Task:** Create or overwrite `.streamlit/config.toml` to set the base dark theme and brand colors.

```toml
[theme]
base = "dark"
primaryColor = "#00F0FF"    # Electric Cyan
backgroundColor = "#0A2342" # Deep Oxford Blue
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#152D4F" # Lighter Blue (Sidebars)
textColor = "#F4F6F8"       # Paper White
font = "sans serif"

```

## 3. CSS Injection (`src/app.py`)

**Task:** Create a function `apply_branding()` in `src/app.py` and call it immediately inside `main()`.

**Specifications:**

* **Fonts:** Import 'Inter' (Headings) and 'Merriweather' (Body) from Google Fonts.
* **Headers:** Force all H1-H3 tags to use 'Inter', Bold weight, White text.
* **Body Text:** Force `p`, `li`, and markdown text to use 'Merriweather', Light weight, off-white (`#E0E6ED`).
* **Buttons:** Apply a gradient background (`#00C6D1` to `#00F0FF`) with a "glow" box-shadow effect on hover. Text color must be dark (`#051628`) for contrast.
* **Success Messages:** Override `.stSuccess` to use a transparent Emerald Green background (`rgba(46, 204, 113, 0.15)`).
* **Containers:** Style `stExpander` and dataframes with "Glassmorphism" (5% white opacity background, thin border).

**CSS Code Block to use:**

```python
def apply_branding():
    st.markdown("""
        <style>
        @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;700&family=Merriweather:wght@300;400&display=swap');

        h1, h2, h3 {
            font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
            font-weight: 700 !important;
            color: #FFFFFF !important;
        }

        p, li, .stMarkdown {
            font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;
            font-weight: 300;
            line-height: 1.6;
            color: #E0E6ED;
        }

        /* Neon Cyan Buttons */
        div.stButton > button {
            background: linear-gradient(90deg, #00C6D1 0%, #00F0FF 100%);
            color: #051628;
            border: none;
            border-radius: 8px;
            font-weight: 600;
            box-shadow: 0 4px 14px rgba(0, 240, 255, 0.3);
        }
        
        /* Glassmorphism Containers */
        div[data-testid="stExpander"] {
            background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05);
            border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
            border-radius: 10px;
        }
        </style>
    """, unsafe_allow_html=True)

```

## 4. UI Layout Updates

**Task:** Update the header section in `src/app.py`.

* **Logo:** Display the logo image at the top of the main container.
* *Code:* `st.image("src/assets/logo.png", width=120)` (Adjust width as needed).


* **Title:** Remove the standard `st.title("ScholarStack")` text if the logo contains the text. If the logo is just an icon, keep the title but ensure it aligns with the logo.
* **Sidebar:** Ensure the "Settings" sidebar inherits the `secondaryBackgroundColor`.

## 5. Verification

* Launch the app (`streamlit run src/app.py`).
* Verify the background is Deep Blue (#0A2342).
* Verify buttons glow Cyan (#00F0FF).

### ** Phase 4 **

"Phase 3 is complete. I have the folder structure and categorized CSV. Now, let's build the final **Phase 4: The Physical Librarian**.
1. **Create `3_download_library.py**`:
* Load `research_catalog_categorized.csv`.
* Iterate through every row where `Is_Paywalled` is False.


2. **The Smart Download Logic (Crucial)**:
* Use `requests` to stream the file. **Use a standard browser User-Agent.**
* **Determine Filename:**
* First, check the `Content-Disposition` header in the response for the true filename.
* If missing, parse the filename from the end of the URL.
* **Sanitize:** Remove illegal characters.
* **Fallback:** If the name is generic (like 'download.pdf' or 'view'), append the first 20 chars of the Title to make it unique.


* **Save:** Save to `./Library/{Category}/{Final_Filename}`.
* **Update Catalog:** Update the `Original_Filename` column in the DataFrame with the actual saved name, and set `Is_Downloaded` = True.


3. **The Export Logic (For Firebase)**:
* After the loop finishes, **create a JSON index file** (`index.json`) inside each Category folder listing the papers in that folder.
* **Zip the entire library:** Use `shutil.make_archive` to create `Library_Export.zip` from the `./Library` directory.
* Print: 'READY FOR DOWNLOAD: Library_Export.zip'.


4. **Final Output**: Save the final dataframe to `final_library_catalog.csv`."

# Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

**Role:** Senior Python Engineer
**Task:** Implement the "Broad Net / Strict Gate" Backdoor Search logic with detailed debug visibility.

## Logic Flow

1. **Backdoor Discovery:**
* Use the "Contextual Probe" (`Original Keyword` AND `User Topic`) to find seed papers.
* Analyze bibliographies to identify the **Top 10 Most Influential Authors** (The Panel).
* **Debug Requirement:** You must print the `display_name` of these 10 authors to the console so the user can verify the expert list.
* **Vocabulary:** Extract the **Top 10** most frequent N-grams (2-3 words) from their recent titles (2020+). These are the "Fishing Synonyms."


2. **The Dragnet (Broad Retrieval):**
* Construct an API query using: `(Original Keyword OR Synonym 1 OR ... Synonym 10) AND (User Topic)`.
* *Purpose:* Use the weak synonyms to pull metadata from the API that might have a truncated index.


3. **The Strict Gate (Local Retention):**
* **Constraint:** Do **NOT** add the synonyms to `self.keywords_list`.
* *Purpose:* The system must strictly enforce that the *Original Keyword* appears in the returned metadata. If a paper is caught via a synonym but lacks the original keyword in its Title/Abstract, it must be rejected by the local filter.



## Implementation Details

* Fetch **Top 10** Authors and **Top 10** Synonyms.
* Ensure the console output clearly lists: `   ✅ Identified Panel of 10 Experts: [Name 1, Name 2...]`.
* Pass the expanded query to the API, but keep the `ResearchCrawler` validation list strict.

### Updated PRP 

**Role:** Search Architect
**Task:** Refactor the Final Dragnet construction to maximize recall by removing the Topic constraint.

**Requirements:**

1. **Drop the Topic Constraint:** In Phase 4 (The Final Dragnet), the API search query must consist **only** of the `(Original Keyword OR Technical Synonyms)`. Do not append `AND Topic`.
2. **Rely on the Gate:** Trust the **Section-Aware PDF Auditor** to do the heavy lifting. Since the auditor only looks for the original keyword in the front-matter of the PDF, it will automatically discard any non-topic papers caught by the broad synonyms.
3. **Synonym Quality:** Ensure the LLM provides **15 technical synonyms** (2-4 words each) to ensure the dragnet is wide enough to find the 100-paper quota.



==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# Phase 1.md
==================================================

### Phase 1: The "Unlimited" Environment

I need to build a comprehensive academic crawler. Update `requirements.txt` to include all these libraries:

* `arxiv` (ArXiv API)
* `semanticscholar` (Semantic Scholar API)
* `scholarly` (Google Scholar wrapper - include rate limiting logic)
* `habanero` (Crossref API for DOI lookup)
* `pyunpaywall` (Unpaywall API to unlock DOIs)
* `sickle` (OAI-PMH client for querying **BASE** and **CORE**)
* `requests` (For OSF, PLOS, DOAJ, and generic APIs)
* `beautifulsoup4` (For scraping DAFx/ISMIR archives directly)
* `pandas`
* `google-generativeai` (For the dynamic taxonomy later)
* `tqdm` (Progress bars)

Install these now.



==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# 9 add OpenAlex API.md
==================================================

You are acting as a Senior Python Developer optimizing the **ScholarStack** project. We are currently facing a critical bottleneck in our search pipeline: the `Crossref -> Unpaywall` check loop is too slow and has a low yield of valid PDFs.

Your task is to integrate the **OpenAlex API** as the primary search source to resolve this. OpenAlex allows server-side filtering for Open Access (`is_oa:true`), which will eliminate the need for thousands of individual HTTP checks.

Please modify `1_search_omni.py` (and create a new utility file if necessary) to implement the following changes:

### 1. Implement the Abstract Reconstructor

OpenAlex stores abstracts as an "Inverted Index" to save space. We need this helper function to reconstruct them into readable text so our Gemini agent can categorize the papers later.

```python
def reconstruct_abstract(inverted_index):
    """
    Reconstructs the abstract from OpenAlex's inverted index format.
    """
    if not inverted_index:
        return ""
    
    # Determine the length of the abstract based on the max index
    max_index = 0
    for positions in inverted_index.values():
        if positions:
            max_index = max(max_index, max(positions))
    
    words = [""] * (max_index + 1)
    
    # Populate the words at their correct positions
    for word, positions in inverted_index.items():
        for pos in positions:
            words[pos] = word
            
    return " ".join(words)

```

### 2. Implement the OpenAlex Search Function

Create a function `search_openalex` that handles pagination and standardizes the output to match our existing dictionary format.

**Requirements:**

* **Filter:** Must use `filter="is_oa:true,has_doi:true"` to ensure we only get valid, free papers.
* **Fields:** Request specific fields to save bandwidth: `title,id,publication_year,open_access,authorships,abstract_inverted_index`.
* **Logic:** Loop through pages until `target_count` is met.

```python
import requests

def search_openalex(query, target_count=50, start_year=None, end_year=None):
    base_url = "https://api.openalex.org/works"
    papers = []
    per_page = 200
    
    # Build filter string
    filters = ["is_oa:true", "has_doi:true"]
    if start_year:
        filters.append(f"publication_year:>{start_year-1}")
    if end_year:
        filters.append(f"publication_year:<{end_year+1}")
    
    filter_str = ",".join(filters)
    current_page = 1
    
    print(f"📚 Querying OpenAlex for: '{query}'...")

    while len(papers) < target_count:
        params = {
            "search": query,
            "filter": filter_str,
            "per-page": per_page,
            "page": current_page,
            "select": "title,id,publication_year,open_access,authorships,abstract_inverted_index"
        }

        try:
            resp = requests.get(base_url, params=params, timeout=10)
            if resp.status_code != 200: 
                break
                
            results = resp.json().get('results', [])
            if not results: 
                break
                
            for item in results:
                pdf_url = item.get('open_access', {}).get('oa_url')
                if not pdf_url: continue

                # Reconstruct abstract
                abstract_text = reconstruct_abstract(item.get('abstract_inverted_index'))

                # Get author
                authors = item.get('authorships', [])
                first_author = authors[0]['author']['display_name'] if authors else "Unknown"

                papers.append({
                    "title": item['title'],
                    "link": pdf_url,
                    "source": "OpenAlex",
                    "year": item.get('publication_year'),
                    "author": first_author,
                    "abstract": abstract_text
                })
                
                if len(papers) >= target_count: break
            
            current_page += 1
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
            break

    return papers[:target_count]

```

### 3. Integration Logic

Modify the main `run_omni_search` function in `1_search_omni.py`.

* **Priority:** Call `search_openalex` *first*.
* **Fallback:** Only call Semantic Scholar if OpenAlex returns fewer papers than `target_count`.
* **Deprecation:** Remove or comment out the old Crossref + ThreadPoolExecutor logic to clean up the code.

### 4. Self-Validation Protocol (Critical)

You must ensure this script works independently before we integrate it into the web app. Add a `if __name__ == "__main__":` block at the bottom of the file that performs the following "Smoke Test":

1. **Run a Test Search:** Search for the topic "Generative AI" with a target of 5 papers.
2. **Validate Links:** For each returned paper, perform a `requests.head()` check on the PDF link to verify it returns `200 OK`.
3. **Validate Abstracts:** Verify that the `abstract` field is not empty and contains readable text (length > 50 chars).
4. **Report:** Print a formatted report to the console showing:
* Total Papers Found
* Valid Link Count
* Valid Abstract Count
* Average Search Time



**Example Validation Output:**

```text
--- SELF-DIAGNOSTIC REPORT ---
✅ Search Complete: 0.8s
✅ Papers Found: 5/5
✅ Link Health: 5/5 (200 OK)
✅ Abstract Reconstruction: 5/5 Valid
------------------------------

```

**Expected Outcome:**
Provide the updated full code for `1_search_omni.py` that includes the OpenAlex search, the integration logic, and the self-validation block.

==================================================

# PRP: Refactor Taxonomy Logic to Structured Output

**Context:**
The current implementation of `src/2_cluster_taxonomy.py` relies on manual JSON parsing and regex cleaning (`clean_json_string`), which is fragile. Furthermore, the categorization logic allows "hallucinations" where the LLM assigns categories that do not align with the paper's text, or generates overly verbose category names.

**Objective:**
Refactor the `cluster_and_categorize` function to use **Gemini's Native Structured Output (`response_schema`)**. This will enforce strict JSON generation and require the LLM to provide "evidence" for every category assignment.

**Target File:** `src/2_cluster_taxonomy.py`

## 🛠️ Engineering Requirements

### 1. Dependency Updates

* Import `typing_extensions` at the top of the file to support schema definitions.

### 2. Schema Definition

Define a strict `TypedDict` schema outside the main function to enforce the output structure:

```python
class PaperClassification(typing_extensions.TypedDict):
    id: str
    category_name: str
    justification_quote: str  # Forces the LLM to prove its work

class TaxonomyResponse(typing_extensions.TypedDict):
    assignments: list[PaperClassification]

```

### 3. Prompt Logic Refactor

Inside `cluster_and_categorize`, specifically within the "Logic for Large Groups (LLM)" loop:

* **Remove:** The legacy `clean_json_string` function call and manual `json.loads` on `response.text`.
* **Update Prompt:** Change the prompt to explicitly request the `justification_quote` (a snippet from the abstract) that supports the categorization.
* **Update API Call:** Modify `model.generate_content` to use the `response_schema` parameter:
```python
response = model.generate_content(
    prompt,
    generation_config=genai.GenerationConfig(
        response_mime_type="application/json",
        response_schema=TaxonomyResponse
    )
)

```



### 4. Implementation Details

* **Input Data:** Continue using `papers_payload` (id, title, description).
* **Processing:** Instead of regex cleaning, directly access `json.loads(response.text)['assignments']`.
* **Sanitization:** Ensure the `category_name` is still truncated to max 4 words programmatically (as a fail-safe), even though the schema encourages brevity.
* **Logging:** Add a `print` statement in the loop to display the `category_name` alongside the `justification_quote` to the console. This serves as a "sanity check" for the user to see *why* a paper was categorized a certain way.

### 5. Cleanup

* Delete the now obsolete `clean_json_string` helper function.

## ✅ Definition of Done

1. The code runs without `json.JSONDecodeError`.
2. Every categorized paper includes an internal "proof" (quote) used by the LLM to make the decision.
3. Category names are concise (Noun Phrases, < 4 words).
4. The fallback logic (retries and "Overview" assignment) remains intact for API failures.

### PRP: LLM-Augmented Research Crawler

**Role:** Senior AI Systems Architect
**Task:** Refactor the `ResearchCrawler` to use LLM-based semantic expansion at both the Topic and Keyword stages.

#### 1. Semantic Topic Expansion (Pre-Search)

* **Logic:** Use the existing `expand_topic_with_llm` method (or create a better prompt) to turn the raw topic into a Boolean string of 3-4 academic synonyms.
* **Goal:** Increase the recall of the "Expert Panel" by searching for "3D Audio" and "Immersive Sound" simultaneously.

#### 2. Technical Vocabulary Synthesis (Expert-Driven)

* **Action:** Instead of counting N-grams, send the list of 150 titles from the Expert Panel to the LLM.
* **Prompt Logic:** *"I am looking for papers about [Keyword]. Below are recent titles from experts in this field. Identify 10 highly specific technical terms, methods, or filter types used in these titles that are synonymous or closely related to [Keyword]. Exclude generic filler like 'dataset' or 'analysis'."*

#### 3. Consolidated Multi-Term Dragnet

* **The Net:** Construct the final query using the LLM's technical synonyms + the LLM's topic synonyms.
* **The Gate:** Apply the **Robust PDF Front-Matter Audit** (ignoring annotations) to find the fuzzy regex of the *original* keyword.

---

### Implementation Block for the Agent

Give this code to the agent to replace the "N-Gram junk" with LLM-curated technical synonyms.

```python
def get_technical_synonyms_from_llm(self, titles, seed_keyword):
    """Uses LLM to clean the 'junk' out of the panel's vocabulary."""
    if not titles: return []
    
    prompt = (
        f"I am researching '{seed_keyword}'. Here is a list of recent titles from the top experts in this field:\n"
        f"{' | '.join(titles[:100])}\n\n"
        f"Based on these titles, provide a comma-separated list of the 10 most specific technical synonyms, "
        f"mathematical methods, or alternative names for '{seed_keyword}'. "
        f"Strictly avoid generic phrases like 'dataset', 'system', 'audio', or 'study'. "
        f"Return ONLY the comma-separated list."
    )
    
    # Trigger your LLM generation method here
    response = self.llm_query(prompt) 
    synonyms = [s.strip().lower() for s in response.split(',') if len(s.strip()) > 5]
    return synonyms

# --- UPDATED SEARCH FLOW ---
# 1. Topic expansion: "Spatial Audio" -> "3D Audio"
# 2. Expert Probe: Find Nelson, Choueiri, etc.
# 3. Titles -> LLM -> Technical Synonyms (e.g., "Recursive Ambiophonics", "Stereo Dipole")
# 4. Dragnet -> PDF Audit

```

# PRP: Robust Taxonomy & Heuristic Data Cleaning

**Context:**
The taxonomy engine currently suffers from two issues:

1. **Low-Quality Input:** Some papers have placeholder descriptions (e.g., "n/a", "no abstract", or short copyright notices) which confuse the categorization.
2. **Formatting Artifacts:** The LLM sometimes outputs verbose names or includes punctuation (like brackets) that get chopped awkwardly.

**Objective:**
Improve data hygiene and category naming using **agnostic heuristics** and **stricter prompt instructions**, avoiding any hard-coded phrases or language-specific rules.

**Target File:** `src/2_cluster_taxonomy.py`

## 🛠️ Engineering Requirements

### 1. Heuristic Data Filter (The "Garbage" Fix)

In `cluster_and_categorize`, inside the loop where `papers_payload` is built:

* **Problem:** We cannot trust that every paper has a valid abstract.
* **Agnostic Solution:** Implement a **Length Check**.
* Check if the `description` string is shorter than **50 characters**.
* **Logic:** A valid academic abstract is virtually always >50 chars. Anything less is likely metadata noise, regardless of the language or source.
* **Action:** If `< 50` chars, overwrite `description` with: `f"Title: {row['Title']}"`. This forces the LLM to categorize based on the Title alone, which is safer than a broken abstract.



### 2. Prompt Refinement (The Formatting Fix)

Update the `prompt` string in the "Logic for Large Groups" section. Instead of asking for arbitrary categories, enforce a **Style Guide**:

* **Instruction:** Add: *"Format category names as concise Noun Phrases (e.g., 'Spatial Audio', not 'Papers about Spatial Audio'). Avoid parenthetical qualifiers."*
* **Constraint:** Keep the "Max 3-4 Words" instruction, as this is a structural constraint, not a content one.

### 3. Agnostic String Cleaning

Update the category cleaning block to be purely syntactic:

* **Import:** Ensure `string` is imported (`import string`).
* **Logic:** Remove the complex regex that targets specific words like "and".
* **Replacement:** Use Python's standard library to strip trailing punctuation/whitespace.
```python
# 1. Trust the LLM's output (constrained by prompt)
cat_raw = item['category_name'].strip()

# 2. Safety Truncate (Generous buffer for long technical terms)
# If > 6 words, it's likely a sentence, so we chop it.
words = cat_raw.split()
if len(words) > 6:
    cat_raw = " ".join(words[:6])

# 3. Universal Cleanup
# Strips any trailing punctuation (brackets, commas, dashes, etc.) from ANY language.
cat_clean = cat_raw.strip(string.punctuation + string.whitespace)

local_map[item['id']] = cat_clean

```



## ✅ Definition of Done

1. **Universal Logic:** The code contains no hard-coded blacklists (no `"International audience"`, no `"and/or/the"`).
2. **Data Safety:** Short/Empty descriptions are automatically handled by the length heuristic.
3. **Clean Output:** Category names are free of trailing punctuation artifacts (e.g., `Category Name,` becomes `Category Name`).

### The Real Architecture: "Dredge Metadata, Audit the PDF"

If we cannot trust OpenAlex's metadata to *prove* the paper is relevant, we can only use it to *suggest* it might be. The **only** way to get the Choueiri paper (and the other 90+ missing ones) is to move the "Gate" to the **actual source text of the PDF.**

The tool must stop trying to be "clever" with OpenAlex's broken snippets. It needs to become a **High-Volume Pipe** that fetches everything even remotely related and then runs the "Strict Gate" on the **Full Text of the PDF** itself.

---

# PRP: Refactoring to "Full-Text PDF Validation"

**Role:** Senior Lead Developer / Search Architect
**Task:** Refactor the `ResearchCrawler` to implement a "Broad Metadata Dredge" followed by a "Strict Full-Text PDF Audit."

## 1. The Broad Dredge (Phase 4 Retrieval)

* **Goal:** Maximize Recall. We don't care about noise here; we care about not missing the 100.
* **API Query:** Use the Expanded Boolean query: `("{keywords}" OR "{synonym1}" ... OR "{synonym10}") AND ("{topic}")`.
* **The Change:** **Disable** the strict local keyword filter during the `execute_openalex_query` phase. If a paper matches the API query, **Accept it into the Download Queue.**

## 2. The "Strict Gate" (Full-Text Validation)

The real "crosstalk cancellation" check happens **AFTER** the PDF is in local memory.

* **Requirement:** 1. Download the PDF to a temporary buffer/folder.
2. Extract the **Full Text** from the PDF (using `PyMuPDF` or `pdfplumber`).
3. Run the **Strict Regex Gate** (`cross[\s\-]*talk[\s\-]*cancellations?`) on the **entire document**.
4. **If found:** Keep the paper and add to `research_catalog.csv`.
5. **If not found:** Delete the PDF and discard the entry.

## 3. Backdoor Discovery (Unchanged)

* Identify the **10 Expert Authors** from the bibliography of the initial seed.
* Extract the **Top 15 technical N-grams** from their recent work to power the "Broad Dredge."
* **Debug:** Print the 10 Author names to the console so we can see the "Expert Panel."

---

### Why this is the ONLY way to solve the Choueiri problem:

1. **OpenAlex is the "Finder":** It finds the *existence* of a Choueiri paper because of its citations and topic.
2. **The PDF is the "Prover":** Since OpenAlex's abstract is garbage/truncated, we don't look at it. We go straight to the PDF, find the phrase "crosstalk cancellation" in the 5th sentence (or 5th page), and **confirm** it.

This architecture treats OpenAlex like a phone book (which is all it's good for) and the PDF as the source of truth. This is how you hit your 100-paper quota with 100% precision and zero "missed" papers.



==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# Fix 2.md
==================================================
# Fix 2

The previous cleanup logic failed, and the CSV is unreadable. Please completely rewrite `3_download_library.py` with this strict logic:
1. **The Cleanup (Aggressive):**
* After downloads attempt to finish, iterate through every subfolder in `./Library`.
* Count the number of **files** inside.
* **If a folder is empty OR only contains hidden system files**, delete the folder using `shutil.rmtree`.
* *Only after cleanup*, create the `Library_Export.zip`.


2. **The Output (Human-Readable):**
* Instead of *only* a CSV, generate a file named **`Library_Catalog.md`**.
* **Format:** Group papers by `Category`.
* For each Category, create a Heading (`## Category Name`).
* List each paper as a bullet point:
* **Title** (Year)
* *Status:* [Downloaded/Missing]
* *Filename:* [Original_Filename]
* *Source:* [URL]
* *Abstract:* (First 200 chars...)


3. **Keep the Download Logic:** Maintain the smart filename detection and user-agent logic we established previously.

### PRP: Hybrid Topic Expansion Refactor

**Role:** Senior Search Architect
**Task:** Refactor the Topic Expansion logic to capture both high-level synonyms and deep technical sub-fields.

#### 1. The "Dual-Axis" Prompt

Refine the LLM prompt to explicitly request these two categories.

* **Prompt Logic:**
"The user is researching **{topic}**.
1. List 10 **Direct Synonyms** or alternative names for this field (e.g., 'Spatial Audio' -> '3D Audio', 'Immersive Audio').
2. List 10 **Technical Sub-disciplines** or specific frameworks (e.g., 'Ambisonics', 'Wave Field Synthesis').
**Combine** these into a single comma-separated list of 20 terms."



#### 2. The Query Construction (The Net)

* **Logic:** `("Keyword") AND ("Topic" OR "Synonym1" OR "Synonym2" OR "SubDiscipline1" ...)`
* **Result:** This single query catches:
* The "Generalist" paper: *"Crosstalk Cancellation in **3D Audio** Systems"*
* The "Specialist" paper: *"Crosstalk Cancellation in **Ambisonics** Rendering"*



---

### Implementation Block for the Agent

Give this code to the agent. It ensures we don't miss the "3D Audio" whale while fishing for the "Ambisonics" minnows.

```python
    def search_via_direct_expansion(self):
        print(f"\n🚀 STARTING DIRECT EXPANSION SEARCH for: '{self.raw_topic}' + '{self.keywords_list[0]}'")
        
        # --- STEP 1: HYBRID TOPIC EXPANSION ---
        print("   🧠 Expanding Topic Scope (Horizontal Synonyms + Vertical Sub-disciplines)...")
        prompt = (
            f"The user is researching '{self.raw_topic}'. Generate a combined list of 20 terms that include:\n"
            f"1. DIRECT SYNONYMS (e.g., '3D Audio', 'Immersive Sound').\n"
            f"2. TECHNICAL SUB-DISCIPLINES (e.g., 'Ambisonics', 'Wave Field Synthesis', 'Binaural').\n"
            f"Return ONLY a comma-separated list of the top 20 terms."
        )
        
        raw_synonyms = self.llm_query(prompt)
        # Clean and split
        topic_anchors = [s.strip().replace('"', '') for s in raw_synonyms.split(',') if len(s.strip()) > 3]
        
        print(f"   ✅ Generated {len(topic_anchors)} Hybrid Anchors: {topic_anchors[:5]}...")

        # --- STEP 2: CONSTRUCT THE SUPER-QUERY ---
        # Logic: (Keyword) AND (Topic OR Anchor1 OR Anchor2...)
        
        clean_keyword = self.keywords_list[0].replace('"', '')
        
        # Build the huge OR block
        topic_block = " OR ".join([f'"{t}"' for t in ([self.raw_topic] + topic_anchors)])
        
        # Final Query
        final_query = f'("{clean_keyword}") AND ({topic_block})'
        
        # ... execute ...

### PRP: Refactoring to High-Yield PDF Auditor

**Role:** Senior Data Systems Engineer
**Task:** Refactor the `ResearchCrawler` to fix the thread-crashes and improve "Expert Panel" targeting.

## 1. Deeper Expert Discovery

* **Action:** Increase the "Probe" count from 50 to **200**.
* **Action:** Select the **Top 15** experts instead of 10.
* **Goal:** This forces the inclusion of specialized authors like Choueiri who might be cited less than the "Founding Fathers" like Blauert.

## 2. Technical Synonym Sanitization

* **Filter:** Discard any learned synonym that matches a "Stop Phrase" list (of the, for the, based on, results of).
* **Requirement:** Learned synonyms must be **at least 2 words long** and contain at least one word longer than 6 characters.

## 3. Robust "Front-Matter" PDF Audit

Refactor the PDF check to be "Crash-Proof":

* **Extraction:** Use `page.get_text("text", flags=fitz.TEXT_PRESERVE_WHITESPACE | fitz.TEXT_DEHYPHENATE)`.
* **Stability:** Specifically ignore "Movie" or "Widget" annotations which are triggering the MuPDF errors.
* **Scope:** Search for the **Fuzzy Regex** (`cross[\s\-]*talk[\s\-]*cancellations?`) only in the first **10,000 characters** of the PDF (the Front-Matter).

---

### The Corrected "Front-Matter" Logic for the Agent

Give this specific code to the agent to replace the current failing PDF check:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def robust_front_matter_audit(pdf_path, target_pattern):
    """Audits the first ~2 pages of a PDF without crashing on annotations."""
    try:
        # Open with 'repair' logic ignored to prevent 'Movie' annotation crashes
        doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)
        text_block = ""
        
        # Limit to first 2 pages (The "Gate")
        for i in range(min(2, doc.page_count)):
            page = doc.load_page(i)
            # Use 'text' mode to ignore non-textual streams (Movies, Widgets)
            text_block += page.get_text("text")
            
        doc.close()

        # Fuzzy Regex Check (Title/Abstract/Keywords area)
        if re.search(target_pattern, text_block, re.IGNORECASE):
            return True
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        # Log the error but don't stop the script
        print(f"   ⚠️ Skipping corrupt/complex PDF {pdf_path}: {e}")
        return False

```



==================================================
FILE: PRPs/# Fix 3.md
==================================================

### ** Fix 3 **

The cleanup logic is still failing because the `index.json` file makes the folders appear 'not empty.' Also, the date format is wrong.
**Please rewrite the cleanup and output section of `3_download_library.py` with this specific logic:**
1. **Strict Cleanup:**
* Iterate through all category folders in `./Library`.
* Check if the folder contains any files ending in `.pdf`.
* **If NO `.pdf` files exist:** Delete the entire folder (using `shutil.rmtree`), even if `index.json` exists.


2. **Date Formatting:**
* In the `Library_Catalog.md` output, ensure the date is strictly formatted as **YYYY/MM/DD**.
* Do not just show the Year. If the date is missing, use 'Unknown'.


3. **Order of Operations:**
* Run downloads.
* Run the PDF-based cleanup.
* **Only then** zip the remaining folders into `Library_Export.zip`.

# Product Requirements Prompt (PRP): Iterative Vertical Search

**Role:** Senior Search Architect
**Task:** Replace the existing "Backdoor" and "Direct Expansion" search methods with a high-recall **Iterative Loop Strategy**.

## 1. Core Logic: "Divide and Conquer"

Instead of sending one massive, complex query to OpenAlex (which causes the API to drop results), the script must execute **8 separate, high-precision searches**.

* **Hypothesis:** `("binaural") AND ("crosstalk cancellation")` yields 100 papers. `("ambisonics") AND ("crosstalk cancellation")` yields 6 papers. Combining them into one query confuses the indexer. Keeping them separate maximizes yield.

## 2. Phase 1: Vertical Identification (LLM)

* **Action:** Query the LLM to identify the **8 High-Yield Search Verticals** for the user's topic.
* **Prompt Requirement:** Explicitly ask for a mix of **Horizontal Synonyms** (e.g., "3D Audio", "Immersive Sound") and **Vertical Sub-disciplines** (e.g., "Binaural", "Ambisonics").
* **Goal:** These 8 terms act as the "Domain Anchors" for the subsequent loops.

## 3. Phase 2: The Execution Loop

* **Action:** Iterate through the list of 8 verticals.
* **Query Construction:** For each vertical, construct a simple, powerful query: `("{Original_Keyword}") AND ("{Vertical_Term}")`.
* **Execution:** Run the standard `execute_openalex_query` for each loop.
* **Deduplication:** The script must handle duplicates automatically (checking `openalex_id` before adding to the catalog) since some papers will appear in multiple verticals.

## 4. Phase 3: The Validation Gate (Unchanged)

* **Action:** Every candidate found in *any* loop is immediately sent to the **Section-Aware PDF Auditor**.
* **Logic:** Download the PDF -> Extract Page 1 & 2 (Text Only) -> Run Fuzzy Regex for the *Original Keyword*.
* **Result:** This ensures that even if a vertical is broad ("3D Audio"), we only keep papers that specifically mention "Crosstalk Cancellation" in the front matter.

### **PRP: BibTeX Export Support**

**Context:**
We are upgrading `ScholarStack`. Currently, we output a `Catalog_Summary.md` and `index.json` files. We need to add a **BibTeX export** feature to support users who write in LaTeX.

**The Task:**
Implement a `generate_bibtex(papers)` function and integrate it into the final "Packaging" phase of the pipeline.

**Technical Requirements:**

1. **File Creation:** The app must generate a single file named `library.bib` at the root of the export package (Zip/Drive).
2. **Citation Key Generation:** You must generate a unique "Citation Key" for every paper.
* **Format:** `[FirstAuthorLastName][Year][FirstWordOfTitle]` (e.g., `Vaswani2017Attention`).
* **Sanitization:** Ensure the key contains only alphanumeric characters (no spaces or hyphens).
* **Collision Handling:** If a key already exists (e.g., two papers by Smith in 2023), append a suffix (e.g., `Smith2023Deep_a`, `Smith2023Deep_b`).


3. **Entry Format:** Use the standard `@article{...}` structure.
* Map `title`  `title`
* Map `authors`  `author` (Format: `Lastname, Firstname and Lastname, Firstname...`)
* Map `year`  `year`
* Map `journal`  `journal`
* Map `doi`  `doi`
* Map `url`  `url`
* Map `abstract`  `abstract`


4. **Integration:** Ensure this file is included in the final ZIP archive and the Google Drive upload logic.

**Output:**
Return the Python code for the BibTeX generator function and show where to call it within the `package_library()` function.

# PRP: "Trust-Based" Logic Refactor

**Role:** Senior Search Engineer
**Task:** Refactor the validation logic to maximize yield by removing the "PDF Download" dependency.

## 1. The New "Lightweight" Gate

Remove the `verify_pdf_frontmatter` requirement from the acceptance loop. Replace it with a metadata check:

* **Step 1:** Construct the `audit_blob` from the OpenAlex `title` + `abstract` + `keywords`.
* **Step 2:** Run the **Fuzzy Regex** (`cross[\s\-]*talk[\s\-]*cancellations?`) on this blob.
* **Step 3:** If Match -> **ACCEPT**.
* **Step 4 (The Safety Net):** If No Match (likely due to truncated abstract), but the paper was found via a specific query -> **ACCEPT** (mark as "Keyword Inferred").

## 2. Deduplication is King

* Ensure that we track `seen_ids` globally across all loops.
* If "Binaural" finds Paper A, and "3D Audio" finds Paper A again, the log should show `[Duplicate] Skipped...` rather than processing it twice.

## 3. PDF is for Storage, Not Validation

* Downloading the PDF becomes a **post-acceptance** task (Phase 3). If the download fails (because it's a landing page), we still keep the metadata in the CSV so you know the paper exists.

## Quick Guide: `open_alex_topic_hybrid_search.py`

This script creates a powerful **Hybrid Search Engine** for your OpenAlex taxonomy tree. It combines:

1. **Lexical Search (BM25):** Finds exact keyword matches (e.g., "Nuclear Physics").
2. **Semantic Search (Gemini + ChromaDB):** Finds conceptual matches (e.g., "Heart Attack" → "Myocardial Infarction").
3. **Smart Caching:** Saves the database locally so you don't pay for or wait for embeddings every time you run it.

---

### 1. Prerequisites

You need Python installed and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install google-generativeai chromadb rank-bm25

```

You also need a **Google AI Studio API Key** (Free tier is sufficient).

### 2. Setup

Ensure your folder structure looks like this:

```text
/my_project_folder
  ├── open_alex_topic_hybrid_search.py   # The script provided above
  ├── openalex_tree.json                 # Your taxonomy data file
  └── tree_chroma_db/                    # (Created automatically after first run)

```

### 3. Configuration

Open the script `open_alex_topic_hybrid_search.py` in your code editor.

Scroll to the bottom `if __name__ == "__main__":` section and replace the placeholder with your actual key:

```python
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "AIzaSy..."  # <-- Paste your Google API Key here

```

### 4. Running the Search

Run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python open_alex_topic_hybrid_search.py

```

**What happens next?**

1. **First Run:** The script will detect that the database is empty. It will flatten your JSON tree and send the nodes to Google Gemini to generate embeddings. This might take a minute or two depending on the size of your tree.
2. **Subsequent Runs:** The script sees the `tree_chroma_db` folder. It **skips** the embedding generation and loads instantly.

### 5. Using the Search

Once loaded, you will see a prompt:

```text
--- Search System Ready (Type 'q' to exit) ---

Query: 

```

Type any term to test the hybrid capability:

* *Exact:* "Nuclear Fusion"
* *Vague:* "Clean energy sources"
* *Concept:* "Study of old coins" (Should find Numismatics or Archaeology)

### 6. Updating the Data

If you change `openalex_tree.json`, the cache will be outdated. To fix this, edit the script's usage section to force a rebuild **once**:

```python
# Change force_rebuild to True for one run
searcher.ingest_tree(tree_data, force_rebuild=True)

```

Run the script, then change it back to `False` to enjoy the caching again.

                You are an expert academic librarian organizing a specific sub-folder of papers on: "{vertical}" (Topic: {topic}).
                Input: {batch_size} academic papers.
                
                Task:
                1. **Analyze**: Identify **{target_cats}** distinct technical themes within this specific sub-field.
                2. **Assign**: ASSIGN EVERY paper to one of these themes.
                3. **Filter**: If a paper is unrelated to "{vertical}", assign "DISCARD".
                4. **Proof**: For every assignment, you MUST quote a specific phrase from the abstract that justifies your choice.
                
                Critical Constraints:
                1. **Style**: Format category names as **concise Noun Phrases** (e.g., 'Spatial Audio', not 'Papers about Spatial Audio'). Avoid parenthetical qualifiers.
                2. **Context**: These papers are ALREADY filtered by keyword "{vertical}". Do NOT create a category named "{vertical}". Break it down further (e.g. if "{vertical}"="HRTF", use "HRTF Measurement", "HRTF Personalization").
                3. **Broad Clusters**: Do NOT map 1-to-1.
                4. **Forbidden**: "General", "Miscellaneous", "Other".
                5. **Density**: Each theme should have {density_note}.
